								<h2>Franchise</h2>
								<p>A franchise is created when an existing, successful business (known as the franchiser) gives another person (known as the franchisee) the right to use its company name, business ideas, branding, products, marketing, business processes, etc in exchange for a fee.</p>
								<div class="boxout did-you-know">
									<h3 class="did-you-know__title">Did you know?</h3>
									<p>Lots of really well-known companies use a franchise model to help them to grow and expand. Examples include McDonald’s, Subway, Hilton Hotels and Costa!</p>
									<p>Franchising can offer a less risky way to start a business as it comes with a recognised business name, tried and tested products, guidelines for marketing, training, etc. However, it can cost the franchisee more money to buy into an existing business (as opposed to starting up on their own) and part of the profit that is made will need to be paid back to the franchiser.</p>

								<h2>Social enterprise</h2>
								<p>Social enterprises are businesses that have <strong>social and / or environmental objectives</strong>. They do not strive to maximise profit for shareholders and owners. Instead, the profit is used to help the business achieve its social objectives. Businesses that re-invest profit in this way are often known as <strong>not for profit</strong> or <strong>non-profit organisations</strong> – basically, the business exists for other reasons, not just to make money and profit for its owners.</p>
								<p>Some other examples of social enterprises include:</p>
								<h3>Co-operatives</h3>
								<p>These organisations are owned and run by its employees and / or customers, who share any profits that are made.</p>
								<h3>Charities</h3>
								<p>A charity is a type of non-profit organisation. The money raised by a charitable organisation is used to help with the work the charity does.</p>

				<h2>Quiz - alternative (inline) Drag 'n' Drop</h2>
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>Draggable area widths are incorrect because the classes on the missing words are the same as the previous quiz. For example <code>word-1</code>. There's never more than 1 quiz per page so this isn't an issue but I've left the 'broken' example here as a reminder. If there was 2 quizzes on a page the missing words on the following quiz would just need to use different classes. If the first quiz has 5 missing words, the first missing word of the following quiz could be <code>word-6</code> for example.</p>

					<h3>Case Study 1: Celebration Toys</h3>
					<p>This company was set up and is owned by three brothers – Richard, Adam and George. The business is run as a partnership. However, because Richard invested more money to help start the business, he gets a larger share of any profit the business makes.</p>
					<p>The company makes and sells soft toys. It has a factory and warehouse where the toys are made and stored, ready to be distributed to customers.</p>
					<p>The company employs people with many different skills – for example, they need staff to…</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Design the toys they are going to make</li>
						<li>Operate equipment to make the toys</li>
						<li>Help promote and advertise the toys to potential customers</li>
						<li>Pack and deliver the toys to stores and customers</li>
						<li>Keep the financial records up to date</li>
						<li>Create and manage the company’s website.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Individual customers can buy toys direct from the company’s website. Some of the toys are great for babies and small children. Other products are designed as gifts for special occasions (such as weddings, birthdays, Valentine’s Day, etc). Celebration Toys don’t have their own stores, but they do have agreements with other businesses who stock and sell their products for them.</p>

					<h3>Case Study 2: Hair Today</h3>
					<p>Lesley is a sole trader and she runs her own hair and beauty salon. She employs three members of staff:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A hair stylist, who can cut, style and colour hair</li>
						<li>A junior stylist, who helps out by washing and drying hair, and generally keeping the salon tidy</li>
						<li>A nail technician, who specialises in nail treatments and nail decoration.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>During the week, Lesley’s salon is very popular with older ladies – some are very regular customers who like to have their hair styled every week. Younger customers come on Friday and Saturday, often having their hair and nails done for special occasions or events.</p>

						<h2>1. Aims and objectives</h2>
						<h3>Mission statement:</h3>
						<p>Our mission is to satisfy our customers with great products and excellent service.</p>
						<h3>Aim:</h3>
						<p>To run a high quality mobile coffee shop every lunchtime in school.</p>
						<h3>Objectives:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>To provide quality at a competitive price</li>
							<li>To have made a profit at the end of every week of trading</li>
							<li>To sell at least one snack for every 5 hot drinks we sell</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="tabs-2">
						<h2>2. Research</h2>
						<p>We carried out both primary and secondary research. We researched competitor prices by visiting various local coffee shops, such as Café Nero, Costa Coffee and Starbucks. We noted the prices and observed customers who visited the shops. We also designed a questionnaire and asked 50 students / members of staff at school to complete it.</p>
						<p>[Chart of outcome]</p>
						<p>Based on our market research, we decided to price our products a little lower than the competition as the customers we talked to said this was the main reason they would go elsewhere to buy hot drinks. We didn’t select a price that was too cheap, as this may give the impression of a poor quality product. The price of the drinks will be less than the competition and still higher than the cost we will incur making them, giving us a good chance of making a profit.</p>
						<p>Based on our research, we have created the following product / price list and calculated the associated direct costs:</p>
					</div>
					<div id="tabs-3">
						<h2>3. Marketing</h2>
						<p>We have identified two key marketing activities that are suitable for promoting our business. These are:</p>
						<h3>Task 1: Social media</h3>
						<p>We will set up a Facebook page to tell our friends about the business and to try to generate as many ‘Likes’ as possible. We will include information about special offers on our Facebook page and, the 100th person to ‘Like’ the offer, will receive a free hot drink (and the 200th person, 300th person and so on).</p>
						<p>We will also create a Twitter account and encourage people to follow our business. The more followers we have, the more people will know about our business which will hopefully lead to more sales.</p>
						<h3>Task 2: Leaflets and posters</h3>
						<p>We will produce leaflets and posters to distribute / display around school. This should raise awareness of our business and encourage people to try our hot drinks. We will also have a special offer of a discount for first time customers.</p>
