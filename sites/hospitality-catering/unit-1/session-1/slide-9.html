									<h2>Food preparation</h2>
									<p>Food preparation jobs are carried out ‘behind the scenes’ to enable food and drink service to take place. These jobs include all levels of chef roles, as well as kitchen assistants and kitchen porters.</p>
									<p>These jobs will require a range of skills, experience and training. For example, head chefs will spend many years completing formal qualifications and working in a kitchen; they will also need a range of non-culinary skills such as being able to motivate staff members, good planning and organisational skills and creativity so they can put together inspiring menu ideas. On the other hand, someone working as a kitchen assistant or kitchen porter will not need any formal training and will perform basic, non-skilled tasks.</p>
									<p>All chefs will require the following skills:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Organisation skills, to help them control timings when preparing dishes</li>
										<li>Preparation skills, to help them organise the equipment they need and weight/measure ingredients when preparing dishes</li>
										<li>A wide range of cooking skills, such as grilling, frying, boiling, roasting, etc</li>
										<li>Knife skills</li>
										<li>Decorative skills, in order to make dishes look well-presented and appetising</li>
										<li>Personal skills, to enable them to work effectively in a team, demonstrate good personal hygiene practice, etc</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In addition to the skills, some chefs will train and specialise in a particular area – for example, pastry, fish, etc.</p>
									<p>You will learn more about different kitchen roles in Session 4 of this Unit.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Food and drink service/Front of house</h2>
									<p>Once all of the food preparation has been carried out backstage, there is a team of ‘front of house’ staff that are responsible for serving the food and drink that has been prepared. As well as being skilled in food and drink service, these members of staff also need to have good knowledge of the food and drink they are serving, be clean, tidy and well presented, and also have excellent interpersonal skills to enable them to interact with customers in a positive way. Examples of jobs in this area include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Waiters/restaurant staff – These members of staff will need to have a good knowledge of how each dish has been prepared and the ingredients that have been used. This information may be passed on to them by the head chef. They may also have an opportunity to taste each of the dishes, so that they are able to talk knowledgeably to customers about them.</li>
										<li>Restaurant managers – Restaurant managers are responsible for all waiters and restaurant staff. They will manage shifts and rotas and will also be the main point of contact for complaints or complex customer queries.</li>
										<li>Bartenders – Bartenders will have a wide range of knowledge across different wines, beer, spirits, cocktails, etc. They may also have specific skills in cocktail making, which can often be a source of entertainment for customers (with glasses/bottles being thrown around and cocktails being free-poured into glasses).</li>
										<li>Sommeliers/wine waiters – Wine waiters have a wide range of wine knowledge, to enable them to recommend different wines to complement food being served.</li>
										<li>Hosts – Hosts will welcome customers at a reception desk and take details regarding the number of seats required at the table, etc. If the party size can be seated at a free table, then the host will lead customers to the table, seat them and give them a menu. If there are no table available, then the host will make sure that the customers are comfortable and content whilst waiting for their table.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Front office</h2>
									<p>In food and drink service, there are staff working behind the scenes to prepare the food and drink and then front of house staff who carry out the service aspect. The same structure applies in accommodation service. A housekeeping team carry out work behind the scenes to clean and maintain the accommodation (you’ll learn more about this on the next slide). The ‘front of house’ aspect of accommodation services is known as the front office, and includes reception services and any other areas that greet and provide services to guests.</p>
									<p>Front office staff provide guests with their first impression of the business and they are responsible for many aspects of accommodation services, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Checking guests in and out of their accommodation</li>
										<li>Taking bookings/reservations</li>
										<li>Arranging additional services for guests, such as restaurant bookings, transport, wake-up calls, etc</li>
										<li>Taking payment from customers for accommodation and any additional items (such as WiFi, drinks, room service, etc)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Typical front office job roles include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Front office manager – In charge of all front office staff, responsible for organising front office activities and staff rotas, as well as dealing with complex customer queries/complaints.</li>
										<li>Receptionist – Duties include checking guests in and out of the accommodation, and acting as the first port of call for customer queries.</li>
										<li>Concierge – Typically only employed in larger hotels, a concierge will look after a team of porters and door staff. The concierge will help guests with additional services during their stay, such as restaurant bookings, directions to attractions, tickets for events, transport, celebration packages for special occasions and any other requests they may have.</li>
										<li>Porter – The main duty of the porter is to transport and store guests’ luggage. At check in, they will arrange to have luggage delivered to the guest’s room and, at check out, they will collect the luggage from the room and take it to reception (often storing the luggage for the guest until they depart).</li>
										<li>Door staff – These members of the front office team will greet guests as they arrive at the accommodation, assist with luggage and direct guests to reception for check in. They may also offer to take the guest’s car and park it for them in the accommodation car park.</li>
										<li>Night porter – The night porter will work throughout the night, answering telephone calls, dealing with guest queries and providing room service. They may also spend time carrying out maintenance duties or preparing areas of the accommodation for the following day (for example, setting up a conference room or function room).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Note that not all accommodation services will employ all of these job roles – it all depends on the size and scale of the organisation.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Housekeeping</h2>
									<p>Housekeeping is the backstage operation within accommodation services. Housekeeping departments are responsible for cleaning and servicing rooms in the accommodation. Aside from a housekeeping manager, the main role in this area is a room attendant. Room attendants will clean rooms on a daily basis – this includes vacuuming, cleaning bathroom and toilet, dusting, cleaning floors, making beds, emptying waste bins, replenishing toiletries/stationery/toilet rolls/tea and coffee making facilities, changing beds/towels where needed and generally tidying the room.</p>
									<p>In some hotels, room attendants will go back to the room later in the day (usually early evening) to do another tidy up and prepare the room for the guest going to bed – they will close the curtains, switch on lamps and turn the bedcovers down…they might even put a chocolate on the pillow!</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Conference and events</h2>
									<p>Larger hotels with conference/function rooms will have members of staff working to provide conference and events services. Responsibilities of the conference and events team will include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Handling initial enquiries for conferences, events and functions and providing information on services offered by the hotel (this might include menus, prices, etc).</li>
										<li>Taking bookings for conferences, events and functions. This may be done online or via the telephone, but sometimes customers may want to visit the venue and have a look at the facilities before booking – in this case, a member of the conference and events team will meet the customer and show them around. At the point of booking, the member of staff will check the diary for availability, and confirm prices, requirements, timings, etc.</li>
										<li>When a booking is made, a deposit payment is often taken (especially for a large event, which could cost the hotel a lot of money to organise)</li>
										<li>Liaising with the customer at regular intervals between the time of the booking and the date of the event. These contacts will focus on discussing guest numbers, food and drink options, special preferences/requirements, etc.</li>
										<li>Leading up to the event, the team will make final preparations for the event – this may include setting out tables and chairs, coordinating deliveries of table decorations/flowers, entertainment services, etc.</li>
										<li>Being on hand throughout the conference/event to make sure that everything runs smoothly and that the customer has everything they need.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Administration</h2>
									<p>Larger accommodation services will have a dedicated administration team to support other departments in the organisation. They will carry out duties such as:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Handling telephone enquiries
										<li>Filing paperwork</li>
										<li>Managing diaries and reservations</li>
										<li>Responding to emails</li>
										<li>Sending out customer invoices</li>
										<li>Liaising with suppliers</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
