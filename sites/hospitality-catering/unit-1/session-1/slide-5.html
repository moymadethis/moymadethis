						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Food and drink services</h1>
					</div>
					<p>There are many different types of business offering food and drink services (they are classed as non-residential businesses, as they do not offer accommodation). They offer a range of products at different prices, quality and level of service.</p>
					<p>While restaurants, pubs, bars and cafes are the typical providers of this service, you will find food and drink services available across the entire hospitality and catering industry. For example, casinos, cinemas, sports venues, golf clubs, bingo halls, theme parks and bowling alleys all have food and drinks available on-site.</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to explore different places we can go to eat and drink.</p>

									<h2>Restaurants</h2>
									<p>Restaurants will serve a variety of hot and cold meals, including starters, main courses and desserts, as well as hot and cold drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). Food may be served to customers at their table or they may serve themselves from a buffet selection.</p>
									<p>Restaurants may specialise in serving a particular type of food – for example, Italian restaurants, Indian restaurants, etc.</p>
									<p>Customers will usually expect a good level of service in a restaurant, and will pay medium to high prices.</p>
									<p>Fine dining restaurants sit at the upper end when it comes to restaurant quality. Here, customers can expect first class service and food, in luxury surroundings.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Takeaways</h2>
									<p>Food is prepared, cooked and served quickly for customers to take away from the outlet and eat elsewhere. Examples include fish and chip shops and Chinese takeaways.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Fast-food outlets</h2>
									<p>Similar to takeaway outlets, but customers have the option to eat their food in the premises or take it out. Examples of fast food include pizza, burgers, fried chicken and hot dogs.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Cafes and coffee shops</h2>
									<p>These are smaller than restaurants and will provide a more limited range of food and drinks (often breakfasts, sandwiches, light meals such as jacket potatoes and salads, cakes, biscuits and scones, as well as hot and cold drinks).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Pubs and bars</h2>
									<p>Traditionally, pubs only served drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). However, most pubs and bars now also serve food. Examples include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Light snacks available in a wine bar or cocktail bar</li>
										<li>Children’s meals available in family-friendly pubs</li>
										<li>Fast-food served in a sports bar popular with football fans</li>
										<li>Fine dining menus available in <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">gastropubs</a></li>

					<p>When food and drink is served, it can be done in a variety of different ways. This will often depend on a number of factors, including the type of food being served, the cost of the meal, the type of customer and the time available for service.</p>
					<p>Click on the buttons below to explore the main options around food and drink service.</p>

						<h3>Table Service</h3>
						<p>This is when meals are served to customers seated at a table – most typically found in cafes and restaurants. The meals may be plated up individually for each customer, or dishes may be provided at the table for customers to share and serve themselves (for example, Spanish tapas and Chinese meals are often served in this way). The different categories of table service include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Plate service – Prepared dishes are served from the kitchen to the customer at their table. This type of service may be seen in a range of catering businesses, from cafes to fine dining restaurants.</li>
							<li>Family service – Dishes are placed in the centre of the table, and serving spoons are provided for people at the table to serve themselves.</li>
							<li>Silver service – This is a specialist type of service, which involves food being plated and served by staff using a spoon and fork at the table. There can be ‘full silver service’ where all food is served in this way, or ‘demi silver service’ where meat or fish is pre-plated and then vegetables and other side dishes are silver served.</li>
							<li>Gueridon service – This is another specialist type of service, which involves food being cooked, finished or assembled in front of the customer at their table (often on a side table). The food is then served from the side table using a spoon and fork.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="counter" class="hide">
						<h3>Counter Service</h3>
						<p>This is when meals are paid for and collected by customers from a long counter (or counters) displaying the food that is available. They can then take the meal to a table to eat it. Examples include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A cafeteria at school, college or university</li>
							<li>A buffet/carvery service in a pub or restaurant – it may be self-service or staff may serve customers at certain parts of the buffet (for example, at a carvery, you would have a member of staff carving and plating meat for customers)</li>
							<li>Fast-food and take away outlets</li>
							<li>Motorway service areas</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In this type of service, queuing is often required but the overall experience for customers is usually simple, quick and convenient.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="personal" class="hide">
						<h3>Personal Service</h3>
						<p>Meals are delivered to the customer, outside of a restaurant environment. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Trays of pre-prepared food provided to passengers on an aeroplane, guests in their hotel rooms or patients in a hospital</li>
							<li>A choice of food and drink available from a trolley on a train</li>
							<li>Snacks and drinks available from a vending machine</li>
							<li>Food that is delivered to an individual at home – for example, a takeaway meal or catering for older people unable to prepare their own meals at home (‘meals on wheels’)</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 class="think-first__title">Activity</h2>
						<p>Consider the following two venues:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>A large sports arena</li>
							<li>A large indoor shopping centre</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Note down as many different examples of hospitality and catering that would take place within each of these venues. Type your notes into the box below. You may find it useful to share and discuss your notes with other pupils in your class and/or your class teacher.</p>
