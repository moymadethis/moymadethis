						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Hospitality and catering services</h1>
					</div>
					<p>So far in this Session, you have learned about different organisations within the hospitality and catering industry.</p>
					<p>Let’s explore this further by considering the range of services that are offered by some of these organisations.</p>
					<p>The hospitality and catering industry serves millions of customers each year, and these customers all have different needs, preferences and expectations. For this reason, the industry needs to be able to provide a wide range of different services to these customers.</p>
					<p>Let’s begin by thinking about the different <strong>accommodation/residential services</strong> that are offered by the industry.</p>
					<p>When we think of accommodation, perhaps the first thing that comes to mind is a bedroom in a hotel or guest house? This is an example of an accommodation service, but accommodation also covers areas such as function rooms (for weddings, parties, etc) and conference rooms (for business meetings, etc).</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to explore the range of accommodation/residential services in more detail.</p>

									<h2>Hotels</h2>
									<p>Hotels are the largest provider of accommodation services within the hospitality and catering industry. Services available can include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Hotels, which offer serviced bedrooms and often additional facilities such as bars, restaurants, room service, etc. There are many different types of hotel including:
											<ul>
												<li>5-star hotels – These hotels offer the highest level of accommodation and service. The bedrooms are luxurious, there are fine dining restaurants, 	high-tech leisure facilities, valet parking and concierge services to offer guests everything they may need during their stay.</li>
												<li>Budget hotels – These are typically small to medium-sized establishments, offering a limited amount of on-site amenities and facilities (for 	example, there may not be an on-site restaurant, gym or swimming pool). Guests choose these hotels because they are low-cost and conveniently situated (for example, near to an airport or motorway).</li>
												<li>National chain hotels – When a hotel brand has a presence in two or more countries, it can be classed as a ‘chain’. All hotels in a chain are 	expected to operate to the same standard, so that customers have an equally satisfying experience regardless of where in the world they are 	staying (examples of hotel chains include Marriott, Hilton, Crowne Plaza, etc).</li>
												<li>Boutique hotels – This term is used to describe small hotels in unique settings (usually offering luxury accommodation).</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Motels/lodges – This type of accommodation is often found near motorway service stations or hotels, aimed at travellers looking for an overnight stay in a convenient location. Accommodation can be lower cost and more basic than that found in hotels. Catering is sometimes limited or provided nearby.</li>
										<li>Guest houses/B&Bs – These are smaller facilities and are often family run, sometimes with only a few bedrooms available (bathrooms may be shared between more than one bedroom). Rooms are serviced but catering may be limited (only breakfast is included in the price of the accommodation).</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Hostels</h2>
									<p>Hostels provide budget accommodation, where guests can rent a bunk bed in a communal sleeping area with access to shared facilities such as bathroom, lounge and kitchen. This type of accommodation is popular with people looking for cheap, short-term accommodation (such as travellers and backpackers).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Self-catering</h2>
									<p>This type of accommodation provides no catering but may be serviced in between use. For example, holiday cottages or city centre apartments provide this type of accommodation.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Holiday parks</h2>
									<p>Holiday parks are larger sites offering accommodation in caravans, log cabins, etc at a lower standard than hotels. Center Parcs is a great example. The accommodation is usually self-catering and the caravans/cabins will be serviced. Holiday parks often include additional leisure facilities such as swimming pools, play areas, tennis courts, etc.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Function rooms and conference rooms</h2>
									<p>Function rooms and conference rooms
Functions rooms and conference rooms are designed to accommodate large numbers of guests, and will include the service of food and drink (ranging from hot drinks and sandwiches for a business meeting to five-course meals and wine at a large, expensive wedding). Additional services such as stationery and technology may also be offered in conference rooms (including notepads, pens, flipcharts, projectors, laptops, etc).</p>
