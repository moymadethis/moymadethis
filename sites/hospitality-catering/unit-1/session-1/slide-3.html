					<p>You can find many different types and size of organisation within the hospitality and catering industry.</p>
					<p>Many hospitality and catering services aim to make a <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">profit</a> in return for their services ...but this is not always the case.</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to learn more about different types of hospitality and catering organisations.</p>

								<li>
									<h2>Commercial organisations</h2>
									<p>Hotels, restaurants, bars, pubs, cafes, etc that are working towards making a profit so that they can continue to operate and grow are known as commercial organisations. The main aim of the organisation is to make a profit (as well as offering hospitality and catering services). If they are able to provide a quality service to customers, then it is likely the organisation will make a profit as customers will be satisfied and continue to use the services (they may even tell their friends and family to do so).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Public sector (non-commercial establishments)</h2>
									<p>Unlike commercial services, which are paid for directly by customers, there are also catering services available in places such as:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Hospitals – The funding for food served to patients comes from the National Health Service (NHS). Depending on patients’ requirements, dishes may need to be soft, vegetarian, vegan, child friendly, low in fat, low in sugar, etc.</li>
										<li>Schools and colleges – Food may be prepared by staff working in the school/college or an outside company may provide this service. There are strict guidelines on the type of food that should be served to children under the age of 16 (for example, they should only have chips twice a week).</li>
										<li>Care homes – As with hospitals, the food that is prepared and served may need to meet certain requirements of clients in the care home. Clients may also need help and support with eating/drinking.</li>
										<li>Prisons – To keep catering costs low, prison inmates are often responsible for preparing and serving food.</li>
										<li>Armed services – This type of catering needs to be able to prepare and serve high volumes of meals (this can either be in a camp during active operations, or in a canteen at army bases).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These services are either offered free of charge (for example, to patients in hospital) or may be made available at a lower cost.</p>
									<p>Catering organisations operating in this sector do not need to make a profit.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Different business types</h2>
									<p>Businesses within the hospitality and catering industry can be divided into three main types:</p>
									<ol class="list-numbers">
										<li>
											<h4>Small to medium-sized business enterprises (SMEs)</h4>
											<p>These businesses have no more than 250 employees. They are usually privately owned companies.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Private companies</h4>
											<p>A private company is independently owned and managed by an individual or group of people. They make all of the decisions about the running of the business and benefit from any profits that the business makes.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Public limited companies</h4>
											<p>A public company has <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">shares</a> that it can sell to the public in order to raise money. If the company makes a profit, then part of this profit is paid out to shareholders, depending on the amount of shares they own.</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Different types of private companies</h2>
									<p>Private companies can be operated in a number of different ways, depending on how they are owned. For example, private companies can be:</p>
									<ol class="list-numbers">
										<li>
											<h4>Sole trader</h4>
											<p>This is simply a private company that is owned and operated by one person. The sole trader owns the business, is responsible for all decisions and will benefit from all profit made by the business (they will also be personally liable for any losses that are made).</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h4>Partnership</h4>
											<p>This is a private company that is owned and operated by two or more people. As with the sole trader, the partners are responsible for all decisions, losses and profits.</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>The key to success for any hospitality and catering organisation is to understand the different needs of customers and offer services to match those needs.</p>
						<p>For example, think of the different needs that customers may have when choosing accommodation. Some people want a cheap, basic room – just a bedroom and a bathroom so they can rest and refresh – a guest house or B&B would be a good option here. Others may look for something more luxurious, with extra facilities such as a swimming pool, gym or spa – a hotel would be more likely to offer these services.</p>
						<p>By recognising these needs and catering for them, then hospitality organisations can attract the right customers and operate very successfully.</p>
