						<h2 class="assessment__title">Preparing for your assessment</h2>
						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Describe working conditions of different job roles across the hospitality and catering industry</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Now let’s take a look at the various working conditions within the hospitality and catering industry. Working conditions cover a range of elements related to employment, including working hours, rates of pay, work-related benefits and annual leave allowance.</p>
					<p>When you become employed by an organisation, you will be given an employment contract. Your contract will set out the specific details of your employment, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The hours you will work</li>
						<li>The duties you are expected to carry out</li>
						<li>The amount of money you will be paid for working (this might be paid as a salary or as an hourly rate)</li>
						<li>Holiday allowance</li>
						<li>Sick pay</li>
						<li>Information relating to uniform or dress code</li>
						<li>Notice period – This is the length of time that employees must give if they want to resign from (leave) their job. This period of time enables the employer to find a replacement member of staff to fill the role.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The employment contract must be agreed and signed by both the employer and the employee.</p>
					<p>There are many different types of contracts offered to employees in the hospitality and catering industry. Click through the slide panel below to explore some examples.</p>

								<li>
									<h3>Permanent contracts</h3>
									<p>These contracts are issued for any job that is offered on a permanent basis. This means that the job holder becomes a permanent member of staff and they will be employed by the company for an indefinite period of time (there is no fixed end date on the contract). Most full-time and part-time contracts are permanent contracts.</p>
									<p>There are a number of benefits associated with being a permanent member of staff, including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Paid time off (whether for holiday, sick, parental or personal leave)</li>
										<li>Opportunities for career development and advancement</li>
										<li>Training and certifications</li>
										<li>Long service leave entitlement</li>
										<li>Job security</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Full-time contracts</h3>
									<p>These contracts are generally offered for permanent jobs. There is no set guidance for what constitutes ‘full-time’ work, but generally full-time workers will work five or more days (at least 35 hours per week), all year round.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Part-time contracts</h3>
									<p>This type of contract is also generally offered for permanent jobs, but they are for people who are contracted to work fewer hours than full-time employees. Someone working on a part-time basis may, for example, work three days per week. The part-time working hours/days that have been agreed between the employer and the employee should be stated clearly on the contract.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Temporary contracts</h3>
									<p>Unlike a permanent contract, temporary contracts are issued when a business knows that a job role will only be offered for a set period of time. For example, someone joining a business to work for 9 months to cover for another member of staff who is taking maternity leave would be given a temporary contract – it would have a set start and end date.</p>
									<p>Fixed-term contracts are similar, in that they have a specified duration agreed in advance.</p>
									<p>Sometimes, temporary and fixed-term contracts may be extended (or converted to permanent contracts) if there is demand in the organisation.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Seasonal contracts</h3>
									<p>As you learned earlier in this Session, the hospitality and catering industry can become especially busy at certain times of the year. If an organisation needs to take extra staff on in order to cover busy weeks/months of the year, they may employ them on a seasonal contract. For example, students may agree seasonal contracts to work during Easter, summer and Christmas breaks.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Live-in contracts</h3>
									<p>A lot of employers offer live-in contracts for staff – this is particularly common with hotel staff or workers living above a pub/bar/restaurant. Some cost towards the accommodation will be deducted from the employees pay each month. This type of contract benefits the organisation as they have staff on hand and available to work at short notice. It also benefits the employee as they have access to convenient accommodation, often at a reduced rate.</p>
