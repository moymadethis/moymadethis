								<li>
									<h3>Communication and interpersonal skills</h3>
									<p>Being able to communicate effectively with customers and colleagues is a very important skill when working in hospitality and catering.</p>
									<p>For front of house staff, being able to communicate in a friendly, helpful and positive way with customers will give a great impression and make customers feel welcomed and cared for. Backstage operations such as housekeeping and food preparation also rely heavily on good communication skills – if kitchen staff don’t communicate effectively with each other during food preparation/service, then dishes may not be prepared on time to serve customers or mistakes may be made.</p>
									<p>People working in the hospitality industry generally enjoy working with people – whether this is dealing with the public or working with teams behind the scenes.</p>
									<p>Patience and sensitivity are also important when communicating with customers, as staff may be called upon to deal with difficult issues. Being polite and sensitive when dealing with customers is important for customer satisfaction.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Initiative and problem-solving skills</h3>
									<p>It is important to be able to work independently in the hospitality and catering industry. As businesses are often very busy, staff don’t always have someone on hand to tell them what to do all of the time ...so you need to be able to solve problems and make decisions on your own.</p>
									<p>Having initiative is all about being able to think and act independently. This means that, if you were faced with a situation or challenge that you haven’t experienced before, you have the ability to resolve the situation or work around it on your own, without having to ask for help.</p>
									<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
									<p>A chef is at work during evening service in a busy hotel kitchen and he runs out of salmon. Without initiative skills, the chef would simply tell the waiters to remove the salmon dish from the menu as the kitchen has run out of ingredients. This would potentially disappoint customers who would like to order the salmon dish (particularly those customers who prefer fish dishes as an alternative to meat dishes).</p>
									<p>If the chef has initiative, he would perhaps explore whether salmon is available in a local store or in another restaurant nearby. If he can quickly source more salmon, then the kitchen operation and service will be able to continue as normal. Alternatively, the chef may be able to create an alternative fish dish using other ingredients that are available to him.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Teamworking skills</h3>
									<p>Most hospitality and catering jobs involve working in a team – for example, a team of chefs working in a kitchen, a team of room attendants working in housekeeping, etc. For this reason, it is essential to be able to work well with others – this includes being able to communicate effectively, listen carefully and co-operate with team members. If teams are unable to work well together, then operations may run less smoothly and service levels may suffer.</p>
									<p>These skills are also important during cross-team working – for example, kitchen chef and waiting staff must be able to communicate and work well together in order to co-ordinate food orders and service.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Punctuality/time keeping</h3>
									<p>Good time keeping is an essential skill as it is very important to get to work on time (punctually) when working in hospitality and catering. If you are due to start a shift at work at a certain time, a lot of people will be relying on you to be ready for work when expected. If you are late, then you will be letting yourself down and those who work with you. For example, if you are working as a room attendant and turn up half an hour late for your shift, the other members of your team will have had extra work to cover in your absence during that time.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Being efficient and well organised</h3>
									<p>Many hospitality and catering jobs can be very busy, with staff often being required to work quickly under pressure to meet deadlines. For example, think of a chef working in a busy kitchen serving hundreds of meals or a housekeeping team with many rooms to clean and service by a certain time so that customers can check in. In order to work quickly and effectively, you need to be highly organised.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Listening and following instructions</h3>
									<p>Whilst working in a hospitality or catering role, you will receive many instructions from people you work with and also from customers. If you are unable to listen to and follow these instructions, then you will not be able to perform your role effectively and the service you provide can be negatively affected.</p>
									<p>Every job role will have specific instructions that must be followed in order to complete certain tasks. For example, there will be instructions for a receptionist and how they should answer the telephone or process bookings, instructions for a commis chef on how to prepare and cook food, instructions for a room attendant on how to make a bed, etc. If these instructions are not followed correctly it can have a negative impact on staff, customers and the business as a whole.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Personal presentation</h3>
									<p>Many jobs in the hospitality and catering industry require staff to wear a uniform (for example, chefs, reception staff, waiters, etc). Uniforms are an important part of staff presenting a smart, professional image. If staff members are smart and well presented, this gives customers a good impression of the organisation as a whole.</p>
									<p>Other benefits of wearing uniforms include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>All staff are dressed to the same standard</li>
										<li>Members of staff can be easily identified by guests</li>
										<li>Staff are smartly presented, which gives a good impression of the business</li>
										<li>Sometimes, uniform offers important health and safety protection for staff (for example, a chef’s apron will offer protection from hot spillages causing burns)</li>
									</ul>	
									<p>As well as wearing their uniform, it is also important that hospitality staff (especially those members of staff working in front of house or front office roles):</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Are clean and hygienic</li>
										<li>Have neat, tidy hair</li>
										<li>Do not have visible body piercings or tattoos</li>
										<li>Do not wear excessive amounts of jewellery or make-up</li>
									</ul>
