						<h2 class="assessment__title">Preparing for your assessment</h2>
						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Analyse job requirements within the hospitality and catering industry</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Working in the hospitality and catering industry can be extremely busy and challenging – you may need to work long hours, late hours, weekends, etc and deal with difficult and demanding customers. However, the work can also be extremely rewarding – especially when you deliver excellent service to customers and they are very satisfied.</p>
					<p>All hospitality and catering businesses will need to employ staff – however, the number of roles they have available will depend on the size and nature of the business. For example, a small farm shop café serving food and drink may only have six staff, a busy fast-food outlet may employ 30 staff, while a large hotel in a city may employ hundreds of staff!</p>
					<p>The availability of jobs in the hospitality and catering industry can depend on a range of factors. Click through the slide panel below to find out more.</p>

									<h3>Supply and demand</h3>
									<p>Supply and demand is all about the balance between the availability of hospitality/catering jobs and the availability of suitable staff to fill these roles. Levels of supply and demand can be affected by a number of factors, including:</p>
									<h3>Availability of trained staff</h3>
									<p>The type of role may determine the availability of suitable staff. The more skilled and specialised the role is, there are likely to be fewer suitable/available candidates to do the job. For example, if a business was looking for a new kitchen porter, they may find that there are lots of suitable candidates available (the job does not require any specific qualifications or experience). However, if a fine dining restaurant was looking for a highly qualified and experienced pastry chef, there may only be a small number of suitably trained candidates who could take on this role. The more specialised and skilled the job, then the harder it may be for a business to find suitable candidates.</p>
									<h3>Seasonality</h3>
									<p>Seasonal factors can have an impact on the supply and demand of jobs in hospitality and catering businesses. There are certain times in the year when hospitality and catering businesses become especially busy and, during these times, there are likely to be many more jobs available as businesses look to take on extra staff to cope with demand.</p>
									<p>For example, think about London and how much busier it becomes during the Summer months – there are thousands of tourists arriving on holiday, popular sporting events such as the Wimbledon tennis championships take place and, in the Summer of 2012, the Olympic Games took place. As visitor numbers increase, hospitality and catering businesses become busier – hotels are fully booked, restaurants see an increase in customers, tourist attractions become more popular, etc.</p>
									<p>Similarly, Christmas is another busy time of year, especially in restaurants, bars and function venues, with parties and celebration lunches/dinners taking place.</p>
									<p>During these peak seasonal times, businesses may need to employ extra staff to cover all of the work. At quieter times, they will not need as many staff and they may reduce the number of employees they have.</p>
									<h3>Location</h3>
									<p>Location is another factor which can affect the availability of jobs. Someone looking for hospitality/catering work in a town or city is likely to have far more opportunities than someone in a smaller town or village (with limited businesses to choose from).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Jobs for specific needs</h3>
									<p>While some jobs are widely carried out across many different types of hospitality and catering businesses (waiters in restaurants, bar tenders in pubs, etc), some jobs are specialised and can only be done by people specifically trained to do them. These jobs may also only be required by certain organisations.</p>
									<p>For example, a pastry chef would be specially trained to produce pastries, breads and desserts. However, not every hospitality/catering business would require a specialist pastry chef. Similarly, someone may have specialist training and experience as a wine waiter/sommelier – again, this is not a role that would be widely needed across the industry, only in higher rated restaurants and hotels.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Training</h3>
									<p>There are two main types of training when working in the hospitality and catering industry. You can:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Carry out learning and training at college</li>
										<li>Undergo training ‘on the job’ when you start working in a business</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Some jobs may require candidates to have completed specific training courses, while others will welcome applications from candidates with limited or no training (with training being provided as part of the job).</p>
									<p>As the hospitality and catering industry involves such practical, hands on roles, ‘on the job’ training is often very beneficial as it helps a new employee to really understand how the business works and the key processes they must follow in their role.</p>
									<p>Experienced staff generally train new members of staff, showing them the key tasks they will be expected to complete and answering any questions the new member of staff may have.</p>
									<p>For example, a new bar tender would most likely spend their first day being shown how to work the till, the location of the different drinks and glasses, the drinks available on the menu, how to pour drinks and how to work the glass-washing machine. Once this has all been covered, the bar tender will be expected to start serving drinks, continuing to learn ‘on the job’.</p>
									<p>For other jobs, members of staff may come to work with existing training and experience. For example, someone starting a new job as a head chef won’t need to be trained in doing this job – they will have already learned how to do it, either in previous organisations or during training at college. What they will need to learn about is the new business and the way it operates (as this might be different to previous places they have worked).</p>
									<p>All new members of staff will also have induction training. This is more general training about the organisation and the way it works (usually covering topics such as health and safety, evacuation procedures, payroll information, requesting annual leave, the structure of the organisation, meeting the team, etc).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Qualifications and experience</h3>
									<p>There is a wide range of qualifications available for people who are interested in pursuing a career in hospitality and catering. Here are some examples:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) – These are practical qualifications, combining full-time or part-time study at college with real work experience. They can take a year or more to complete.</li>
										<li>Apprenticeships – These programmes combine paid employment with training in specific hospitality roles. During an apprenticeship, you will be employed in a hospitality/catering role, gaining valuable work experience and you will receive teaching support from a training provider as well.</li>
										<li>Higher National Certificates (HNCs) and Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) – These are higher level vocational qualifications, suitable for those looking to work in management positions. They can take one or two years to complete, through either full-time or part-time study.</li>
										<li>Degree – You can complete a Foundation Degree or an Honours Degree. A Foundation Degree offers practical, work-based skills and knowledge and can be completed in two years through full-time study, while an Honours Degree is more academic and can take three or four years to complete full-time.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>As you can see, some of these qualification options also build in work experience. This can really benefit an organisation, as new members of staff join the company with a good knowledge/understanding of hospitality and catering, but also some experience of the skills and behaviours required to be effective at work.</p>
									<p>Experience can be very valuable, especially in the hospitality and catering industry. For example, let’s imagine you are a restaurant manager looking to appoint a new waiter. You need the new waiter to start work quickly, as the business is having a particularly busy period. You have two possible candidates – one has a hospitality qualification but limited experience, the other one has no formal qualifications but has worked as a waiter in a similar restaurant for the past three years. Which candidate would you choose and why?</p>
