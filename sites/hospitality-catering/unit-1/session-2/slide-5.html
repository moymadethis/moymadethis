						<h2>Working hours</h2>
						<p>Hospitality and catering staff do not work typical 9 to 5 working days. Hotels are open all day and all night, 7 days a week, and catering businesses are also open for long hours every day. For this reason, working hours need to be broken down into separate shifts so that the business always has staff working across the business whenever necessary.</p>
						<p>Shift patterns will depend on the job role that is being carried out. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Restaurant chefs may work from 10am to 2pm (for lunch preparation and service) and then from 5pm to 10pm (for dinner preparation and service).</li>
							<li>Chefs in a hotel may work from 5am to 10am (for breakfast preparation and service), 10am to 5pm (for lunches and light snacks) and then from 5pm to 11pm (for dinner preparation and service).</li>
							<li>Hotel receptionists may work in shifts to ensure that the reception desk is covered from 6am to 10pm (after this time, the night porter may carry out a reduced reception service until the following morning).</li>
							<li>Room attendants may work from 7am to 4pm to clean and service rooms in between guests checking out and checking in. Some hotels may also have room attendants working in the early evening to ‘turn down’ rooms, ready for guests going to bed.</li>
							<li>Waiting staff will work similar shifts to chefs in restaurants or hotels– they will use preparation time to set tables, polish glasses/cutlery, fold napkins, etc before service begins.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Working hours must also incorporate rest breaks for all workers. For example, adult workers must have at least a 20-minute break if their working day is longer than 6 hours and they must also have a 24-hour break from work during any 7-day period. Young workers (aged 15 to 18) have slightly different entitlements when it comes to rest breaks – they must have at least a 30-minute break if their working day is longer than 4.5 hours and they must also have 2 full days away from work during any 7-day period.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="pay" class="hide">
						<h2>Rates of pay</h2>
						<p>Rates of pay will vary greatly depending on the type of role you do, how specialist it is, how much responsibility you have and the type of contract you are working on. For example, owners or managers of a business will earn more money than operational staff – this is because they have more responsibility for decision making and the overall performance/success of the business.</p>
						<p>Staff can either be paid a salary or an hourly rate.</p>
						<p>Salary is paid at the same rate every month – for example, if a member of staff has a salary of £20,000 per year, they will be paid this money over 12 equal instalments, on the same day every month. This amount will not change each month, even if the employee works more hours than they are contracted to.</p>
						<p>Some members of staff will work on an hourly rate, instead of a salary. This means that they have a specific rate that is paid for every hour they work. So, the more hours they work, the more money they will earn (or, if they don’t work many hours in a certain month, they will not be paid very much).</p>
						<p>You can see a breakdown of typical hospitality rates of pay on the <a href="https://www.totaljobs.com/salary-checker/average-hospitality-salary" target="_blank">TotalJobs website</a>.</p>
						<p>Perhaps you could also try looking at a range of job adverts for hospitality and catering jobs to see the different rates of pay on offer.</p>
						<p>Employers must always adhere to the national minimum wage when paying staff – this is the minimum hourly rate of pay that can be paid to staff, and this differs across different age groups. For example, a 17-year-old must be paid at least £4.05 per hour, while a 24-year-old must be paid at least £7.05 per hour. You can see up to date information relating to the national minimum wage at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates" target="_blank">gov.uk</a>.</p>

						<h2>Holiday entitlement</h2>
						<p>According to <a href="ww.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights" target="_blank">gov.uk</a>w, almost all workers are legally entitled to at least 5.6 weeks’ paid holiday every year. Bank holidays may be included in this entitlement, or they may be offered as additional days off.</p>
						<p>So, if a member of staff works 5 days per week, then they must receive at least 28 days’ paid holiday per year (this is the equivalent of 5.6 weeks of holiday).</p>
						<p>As you have learned, not all employees will work 5 days per week – there will also be part-time staff working fewer than 5 days per week. These members of staff will still be entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid holiday, but this will equate to fewer than 28 days over the year, as they are working fewer days/hours per week.</p>
						<p>Some organisations will make a decision to offer staff more than the 5.6 weeks legal entitlement. For example, organisations may offer full-time staff 30 days’ holiday per year, plus bank holidays.</p>
						<p>The specific holiday entitlement that is available to staff will be specified in their employment contract. The contract may also state what is expected of staff when it comes to requesting holiday – for example, managers may need at least 5 days’ notice for holiday requests or there may be certain times of year when holiday requests will not be authorised (such as the period of time leading up to Christmas in a busy restaurant).</p>

						<h2>Remuneration (tips, bonus payments, rewards)</h2>
						<p>The term ‘remuneration’ refers to the money that is paid to an employee for the service they provide. This mainly consists of their hourly pay or salary. However, it can also include additional benefits/rewards, such as:</p>
						<ul>
<li>Tips – These are additional payments made by customers to staff, as a reward for good service (for example, diners in a restaurant may pay an additional 10% on top of their bill if they feel that they have received good service)</li>
<li>Bonus payment – This is usually paid in addition to a worker’s regular weekly or monthly pay. The amount of bonus that is paid will be variable and is often linked to performance (either by the individual or the organisation as a whole). For example, bonus payments may be made if the organisation earns a certain level of profit during the year.</li>
<li>Rewards for additional hours – Employees are often paid extra money for working unsocial hours (such as night shifts or weekend work) or for working more hours than they have agreed in their contract (overtime)
<li>Allowances – An allowance is a sum of money that is paid to an employee in order to cover a cost or expense. For example, if a hospitality organisation employed someone who had to travel a long way to get to work each day, the organisation might give the employee a ‘travel allowance’ to cover the cost of travel (either fully or partially).</li>
<li>Benefits – Additional financial benefits offered by employers include pension schemes, contribution towards medical/dental costs, free eye tests and access to company cars. These are all designed to reduce the amount employees need to spend in these areas, therefore saving the employee money.</li>
<li>The provision of meals and uniforms while at work – This has the benefit of saving the employee money as they don’t have to pay for as many meals each week and costs related to buying and washing their own clothes is also reduced.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Because all of the examples we have looked at here have a monetary value, they are classed as tangible benefits. Intangible benefits can also be offered to employees – these do not have a monetary value, but they still offer motivation and a sense of achievement to staff (examples include recognition, such as an ‘Employee of the Month’ award, access to training and development opportunities, or the provision of flexible working hours for new parents to accommodate childcare needs).</p>
