						<h1 class="hgroup__title">External influences</h1>
					</div>
					<p>The hospitality industry is also subject to many external factors/influences. These are influences that exist outside of the organisation (and often outside of the industry as a whole). Organisations have little or no control over these influences, but the external influences can have a dramatic effect on the success of the organisation.</p>
					<p>These external influences can be broken down into the following categories:</p>
						<li>Political</li>
						<li>Economic</li>
						<li>Social</li>
						<li>Technological</li>
						<li>Legal</li>
						<li>Environmental</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The acronym 'PESTLE' can be used to help you remember these external influences – click on each letter below to explore some examples.</p>

					<div id="political" class="hide">
						<h3>Political</h3>
						<p>Political events and government decisions can impact on the hospitality and catering industry. Similarly, events that are linked to politics can also have an impact. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Terrorist attacks can have a negative impact on tourist and passenger numbers</li>
							<li>Increased taxes will increase costs for an organisation, meaning that it needs to make more profit in order to cover these costs</li>
							<li>Changes in government legislation can impact on the way in which an organisation operates (for example, changes to data protection law may mean that a hotel has to change the way it collects and stores customer information, etc)</li>
							<li>The Brexit process may affect staffing levels in the hospitality and catering industry, with many European workers being employed – if these European workers choose to leave the UK, then hospitality and catering organisations will have to spend a great deal of time and money recruiting and replacing these workers</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="economic" class="hide">
						<h3>Economic</h3>
						<p>Economic factors can influence the level of customer demand for hospitality and catering services. The strength of the overall economy can determine how much or how little income (money) people have available to spend.</p>
						<p>For example, if the economy is strong, then people are able to earn good wages and their essential bills (mortgage, rent, utility bills, etc) are affordable. This means that they are likely to have money left over each month – which is referred to as ‘disposable income’. People tend to enjoy spending their disposable income on things that they enjoy or that they are interested (and this can include things like eating out at restaurants, going to the cinema, staying in hotels, etc), which can have a positive impact on hospitality and catering organisations.</p>
						<p>However, during periods of low or no economic growth (known as a ‘recession’), people won’t always have as much disposable income to spend (people may also lose their jobs during a recession, leaving them with even less money to spend). In this case, people are more careful with their money and will stop spending money on ‘non-essential’ or luxury items (eating out in restaurants, going to the cinema, going on holiday, etc), so this in turn can have a negative impact on hospitality and catering organisations. Organisations can respond to this by offering customers better value for money in an attempt to encourage them to spend money (for example, money-off vouchers, discounts and special offers).</p>
					</div>
					<div id="social" class="hide">
						<h3>Social</h3>
						<p>Social factors can have an impact on customers’ opinions, attitudes, tastes and preferences. For example, more people now are interested in organic food and knowing where their food has come from, how it has been produced and how far it has travelled (food miles). In order to appeal to customers, hospitality and catering organisations will need to consider these social factors and think about how they can change menus to reflect new trends and preferences.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="technological" class="hide">
						<h3>Technological</h3>
						<p>As you learned earlier in this Session, people use technology a great deal in their everyday life and expect to be able to do so when accessing hospitality and catering services. For example, customers expect to be able to book restaurant tables and hotel rooms at any time, day or night, from their computers or mobile devices. This means that it is important for a hospitality and catering organisation to have a website and be technologically able to process online bookings, enquiries, payments, etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="legal" class="hide">
						<h3>Legal</h3>
						<p>All businesses in the UK are bound by certain laws and legislation. Businesses must be aware of the legislation and regulations that directly affect their operations and make sure they have policies and procedures in place to adhere to them.</p>
						<p>For example, every business must adhere to health and safety law, in order to protect their employees and their customers from harm. Other examples of legislation that hospitality and catering organisations may need to be aware of include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Minimum wage legislation</li>
							<li>Licensing laws for any organisations that serve alcohol</li>
							<li>Employment legislation, including maternity leave and redundancy</li>
							<li>Equality legislation</li>
							<li>Legislation relating to discrimination in the workplace</li>
							<li>Working time regulations</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It can cost an organisation a lot of money to establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with this legislation. However, the cost of non-compliance can be even greater…this can lead to legal costs, compensation payments, etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="environmental" class="hide">
						<h3>Environmental</h3>
						<p>We looked at environmental issues earlier in this Session and considered the impact that environmental issues can have on a hospitality and catering organisation. As people become more aware of environmental issues and seek to take actions that may avoid harming the environment, this can have a negative impact on hospitality and catering organisations. For example, if people decide to limit travelling by airplane to reduce emissions, then this can have a negative effect on the tourist industry, which in turn will affect hospitality and catering organisations.</p>
						<p>If an organisation can show they are taking positive actions to support environmental issues (reducing waste, increasing recycling, etc), then this will present a favourable image to customers.</p>
