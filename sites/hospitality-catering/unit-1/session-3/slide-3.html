						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Trends and customer preferences</h1>
					</div>
					<p>The success of any hospitality and catering organisation is down to its customers – the more customers it can attract, the more successful the business will be…and without customers, a business would fail to operate.</p>
					<p>If customer preferences change, due to trends, new ideas or changes in their lifestyle, then the choices they make when it comes to using hospitality and catering organisations can be affected. For this reason, it is important for hospitality and catering organisations to be aware of these changes and try to adapt the business to suit changes in customer needs and preferences.</p>

									<h2>Technology</h2>
									<p>Many developments in technology have taken place in recent years, with customers now using mobile websites, apps and social media on a regular basis. Hospitality and catering organisations need to be able to offer technological services in order to keep up with this trend. For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>If a hotel does not have a website or online booking system, it may lose customers to other hotels who do offer this service – customers want to have the convenience of being able to book a hotel room quickly, easily and at any time day or night (they don’t want to be limited by having to telephone the hotel during set hours, just to make a booking).</li>
										<li>A restaurant that sets up a Facebook page will be able to appeal to a wider range of customers – and the page gives the restaurant the opportunity to share news, offers, photographs of menus, prices, dishes, and so on to try and attract customers to the restaurant…and it doesn’t cost a penny!</li>
										<li>Think of the way online food ordering website such as JustEat.co.uk have tapped into the way customers use technology – offering customers the convenience of being able to use an app to find and order food delivery services in their local area.</li>
										<li>A hotel may use technology to offer a quick check-in/check-out process for guests, via a touch screen computer. This would appeal particularly to business customers, who want to save time when leaving a hotel in the morning and heading off to meetings or to catch transport.</li>
										<li>In some restaurants, customers can use handheld tablets or touch screen computers to place their order (for example, McDonald’s have introduced a touch screen computer ordering system in their restaurants).</li>
										<li>A business can set up its own website to share information with customers about the services it offers.</li>
										<li>A business can also use other websites to help promote its services – for example, having a Twitter feed, offering special discounts/promotions on sites such as Groupon, posting videos of the establishment on YouTube, using review sites such as TripAdvisor to attract new customers, etc.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>If organisations can incorporate the use of technology, they can continue to attract customers by adapting to suit their preferences and needs. Organisations who are able to offer a unique technology-based service will stand out from competitors and become even more appealing to customers (especially those who want to be early adopters of new ideas). For example, some hotels allow guests to use an app on their device to control facilities in the hotel room (such as the TV and lighting), order room service, book spa appointments and so on…all by tapping on their phone or tablet!</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>International travel</h2>
									<p>It is now easier than ever for people to travel to and visit places all over the world! For this reason, it is important for hospitality and catering organisations to consider the needs and preferences of international guests.</p>
									<p>For example, a large London hotel may employ staff who are able to speak different international languages, staff may undergo training so that they are aware of different customs/cultures when interacting with guests and menus offered in the hotel may be adapted to appeal to international guests (such as including Halal meats for Middle-Eastern guests or, if many hotel guests are Chinese, incorporating some traditional Chinese food into the menu).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Health and wellbeing</h2>
									<p>Another trend that hospitality and catering organisations can cater for is the interest that people have in health and wellbeing. People are increasingly health conscious, both in the dietary choices they make and the physical activity they take part in. If hospitality and catering organisations can consider the needs of these customers in the service they provide, the organisation can achieve great success. For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A café or restaurant may choose to include healthy food choices on the menu (such as vegan meals, gluten free and sugar free options, fruit and vegetable smoothies, etc)</li>
										<li>A hotel offering a range of health and fitness facilities (such as a spa, exercise classes, swimming pool, gym, etc) will appeal more to health conscious customers as opposed to a similar hotel in a similar location, but without fitness facilities</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Environment and sustainability</h2>
									<p>Climate change and the environment are current issues that people support very strongly. If hospitality and catering organisations can demonstrate their support of these issues and show that they are taking positive actions to be environmentally friendly, then this will appeal to customers who are conscious of the impact their actions can have on the environment. For example, an organisation may:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Use renewable energy sources such as wind power or solar power</li>
										<li>Have policies in place to save water, such as hotels only providing showers in bathrooms as they use a lot less water than baths or encouraging guests to reuse towels to reduce the amount of laundry that is needed</li>
										<li>Have good systems in place for recycling as much waste as possible</li>
										<li>Work to reduce food waste by offering meals in smaller portions or using leftover ingredients to prepare meals for staff</li>
										<li>Have policies in place to save energy, such as hotels having lights that automatically switch off when guests leave the room or kitchens using economic energy sources such as halogen hobs and lightbulbs</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Another key area that some hospitality and catering organisations may choose to support is the reduction in food miles. This refers to the distance that food has travelled from the place it was grown/reared/produced to the place it is served or consumed. The further food has to travel, the greater its impact on the environment. So, for this reason, a hotel or restaurant may pride itself on the use of local, seasonal foods in its menu – these foods will have very low food miles, which means they are fresher, and contain more nutrients and flavour.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Innovative cooking techniques</h2>
									<p>New, innovative cooking methods can be a threat to success in hospitality/catering organisations. For example, if a new cooking method emerges and suddenly becomes very popular with diners, any restaurants not offering this type of method may lose customers. If this happens, the business needs to consider whether it is able to adapt its service to incorporate this new method in order to retain customers.</p>

					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>As there are so many hospitality and catering organisations for customers to choose from, there can be a lot of <strong>competition</strong> amongst these organisations to attract customers.</p>
						<p>For example, when many organisations all offer an identical service, then this can limit the number of customers available to each organisation. However, if an organisation can offer something different that particularly appeals to current trends and customer preferences, then this organisation will stand out from the competition and attract more customers.</p>
						<p>Let’s imagine that there are two cafés in a small town. At breakfast time, one café specialises in full English fried breakfasts with toast, tea and coffee. The other is an organic café, serving healthy breakfasts such as avocado on toast, granola, yoghurt and fruit. In today’s health conscious world, which café do you think may attract most customers?</p>
