					</div>
					<p>In a restaurant, there are many different members of staff involved in front of house operations – you can click through the slide panel below to learn more.</p>
					<div class="flexslider-wrap">
						<div class="flexslider">
							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Restaurant Manager</h2>
									<p>The Restaurant Manager has overall responsibility for the restaurant and all front of house operations. They are in charge of managing bookings/reservations, communicating information to the kitchen via the Head Chef, planning shifts and staff rotas, dealing with complex customer queries/complaints and ensuring the overall smooth running of the restaurant.</p>
									<p>Each member of staff in the restaurant will have a clearly defined job description – this will help the Restaurant Manager to make sure that duties are allocated to the correct staff members, so that tasks are performed efficiently and effectively.</p>
									<p>Planning shifts and staff rotas can be a particularly challenging task in establishments that experience peak seasons and slow seasons – changes in demand can mean that different levels of staffing are needed throughout the year, and the manager may need to hire temporary workers to help out during particularly busy times.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Head Waiter/Waitress</h2>
									<p>The Head Waiter/Waitress is second in charge of the restaurant. Their responsibilities may include welcoming customers and showing them to their table, communicating key information to waiting staff and acting as the first point of contact for any customer complaints referred on by the waiting staff.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Wine Waiter (Sommelier)</h2>
									<p>The Wine Waiter (or Sommelier) has a wide range of specialist wine knowledge and they will use this knowledge to recommend wines that will particularly complement the food that is being served. The Wine Waiter will also serve the wine to the customer during their meal.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Waiting staff</h2>
									<p>Waiting staff have many different responsibilities – this includes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Taking customer orders</li>
										<li>Offering recommendations</li>
										<li>Offering information on any special dishes available</li>
										<li>Advising customers if any menu choices are unavailable</li>
										<li>Providing information relating to the content of dishes (for example, if customers have allergies)</li>
										<li>Serving drinks</li>
										<li>Serving food</li>
										<li>Clearing tables</li>
										<li>Laying tables</li>
										<li>Checking that customers are satisfied with the food and service during and after their meal</li>
										<li>Providing the bill to the table</li>
										<li>Arranging for payment to be taken</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>Establishments offering different types of service will require different staff. For example, a small café or a fast food restaurant would not have a Head Waiter or a Sommelier! Instead, a small café may have only one or two members of front of house staff who are responsible for taking all orders and serving them to customers at their table. Similarly, a fast food restaurant will have a number of counter staff who are responsible for taking and serving orders.</p>
