					</div>
					<p>In the previous Session, you learned about the importance of documentation and record keeping in a kitchen environment. There are also many reasons why documentation is needed front of house.</p>
					<div class="boxout think-first">
						<h2 class="think-first__title">Think first</h2>
						<p>Can you think of any important information that would need to be recorded during front of house operations? Type some ideas into the box below before you move on.</p>
						<form class="journal-entry">
							<textarea rows="4" placeholder="Make some notes (optional)..."></textarea>
							<button class="btn btn--primary btn--save"><span>Save</span></button>

									<h2>Stock control</h2>
									<p>As you learned on the previous page, stock control is an important part of front of house operations. In order for stock control processes to operate effectively, accurate documentation must be kept.</p>
									<p>The following records should be kept up to date to ensure effective stock control:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Stock control sheets</li>
										<li>Stock check records</li>
										<li>Stock usage reports</li>
										<li>Order forms to show what has been purchased, in what volume and when</li>
										<li>Delivery notes from suppliers</li>
									</ul>
									<p>All of this documentation helps to keep tabs on stock levels and, through careful monitoring of stock levels and requirements, stock can be ordered at the right time and replenished before it runs out.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Personnel records</h2>
									<p>Personnel records are all about staff and information relating to their employment. Examples of personnel information which may be held include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Personal details</li>
										<li>Job application information (their CV, application form, etc)</li>
										<li>The hours that they are contracted to work (this might include set days/nights of the week)</li>
										<li>Wages (either salary or an hourly rate of pay)</li>
										<li>Tax information</li>
										<li>National insurance details</li>
										<li>Records of any training they have completed</li>
										<li>Details of any accidents they have had in the workplace</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Keeping an accurate record of this information enables an establishment to manage its staff effectively – for example, staff will be paid on time, at the correct rate of pay and the right amount of tax deducted from their wage.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Health and safety/hygiene</h2>
									<p>As with kitchen operations, health and safety is a very important consideration front of house. When customers visit an establishment, they expect to visit a safe environment, which is free from hazards and risks. Similarly, members of staff also expect their workplace to be a safe place to be.</p>
									<p>To maintain high levels of health and safety, an establishment may keep the following records:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Fire certificate</li>
										<li>Staff training records (particularly in relation to health and safety training, such as first aid or food handling courses)</li>
										<li>Accident book (this will be used to record accidents and near misses in the workplace; this information helps to identify and remove hazards that could cause future accidents)</li>
										<li>Food hygiene checks</li>
										<li>Cleaning checks (this could include checks that are made on the cleanliness of equipment, toilets, etc)</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Bookings/reservations</h2>
									<p>While this type of documentation is not required in all establishments (for example, a fast food restaurant or takeaway outlet would not take bookings or reservations), it is important in restaurants.</p>
									<p>The process of taking and recording bookings needs to be highly effective, especially in busy restaurants. All staff must be clear on the need to accurately and clearly record this information in a centralised location (such as an electronic booking system or a diary used to record all reservations on a daily basis).</p>
									<p>Consider the consequences of not keeping this information up to date…the restaurant would potentially have many customers arriving for tables that they have booked, but the restaurant would not be expecting them!</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Financial</h2>
									<p>This type of documentation will usually be the responsibility of the Restaurant Manager. They will monitor and manage information relating to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Purchasing costs (how much has been spent on stock, uniforms, leasing equipment, etc)</li>
										<li>Staff wages</li>
										<li>Tips and bonuses</li>
										<li>Customer bills and payments</li>
										<li>VAT</li>
										<li>Supplier invoices and payments made to suppliers</li>
									</ul>
									<p>They will use this information to monitor the profitability of the establishment – if costs are too high, then the business will struggle to make profit and the Restaurant Manager may then need to identify actions that can be taken to reduce costs in some areas of the operation.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>The term ‘stock control’ may also be used in relation to the security of stock that is held in the kitchen, and controlling who has access to stock and when. Stock is worth a lot of money and is therefore very valuable to an organisation – for this reason, it should be stored as securely as money would be. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Stock areas may be locked (including lockable fridges/freezers)</li>
							<li>Only certain members of staff may be allowed to access stock areas</li>
							<li>CCTV cameras may be used to monitor access to stock areas</li>
						</ul>
