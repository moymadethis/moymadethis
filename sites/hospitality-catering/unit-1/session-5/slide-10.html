					</div>
					<p>Under the Health and Safety at Work Act, any food/drink establishment has a legal obligation to ensure that it is a healthy and safe place for customers, employees, employers, visitors, etc.</p>
					<p>Let’s illustrate this by taking a look at the key health and safety actions that a restaurant owner would need to take.</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to find out more.</p>

							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Risk assessment</h2>
									<p>The business should carry out regular risk assessments in order to identify potential hazards that could cause harm to staff and/or members of the public. If a risk assessment identifies hazards, then suitable actions must be taken to reduce or remove these hazards, therefore minimising the risk of harm.</p>
									<p>There can be a number of potential hazards in a restaurant – for example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Steps or stairs</li>
										<li>Waiting staff carrying hot food/drinks</li>
										<li>Food being served to customers on hot plates</li>
										<li>Risk of tripping on chair/table legs, customers’ bags/coats, etc</li>
										<li>Risk of slipping on wet floors – for example, if a drink has been spilled or water has been splashed onto the toilet floor</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Risk assessments will help the restaurant owner to become aware of these potential hazards, and ensure there are plans in place to minimise them.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Health and safety policy</h2>
									<p>Businesses must have a comprehensive health and safety policy that is made available to all members of staff. The policy will provide information relating to the way in which hazards and other health and safety issues are to be dealt with. The policy must be stored in a central place and be easily accessible at all times, so that it can be referred to when necessary. A health and safety inspector may ask to see this policy during a visit to the business.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Food hygiene</h2>
									<p>It is a legal requirement that every member of staff that handles food must have a Food Hygiene Certificate. In order to gain this Certificate, members of staff must pass a test covering a range of food hygiene issues including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The legal responsibilities of food handling</li>
										<li>Ways in which food can become contaminated</li>
										<li>Food-related illnesses</li>
										<li>Steps that can be taken to prevent food becoming contaminated</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Insurance</h2>
									<p>As there are risks to the public, i.e. customers of the establishment, as well as staff, the business should have both public liability insurance and employers’ liability insurance. For example, if a customer suffered an injury in the restaurant, the business would be held liable for the injury and could face a fine or be required to pay compensation to the customer. Without public liability insurance, this could potentially cost the business a lot of money. Employer’s liability insurance works in a similar way, in that it covers the business for any costs arising from staff suffering an injury at work.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Fire safety</h2>
									<p>Businesses must follow certain fire regulations, including the provision of fire extinguishers, clearly marked and unobstructed fire evacuation routes, an evacuation plan that all staff are aware of and working fire/smoke alarms fitted and tested regularly.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>First aid</h2>
									<p>The restaurant should also have staff trained so that they are able to provide basic first aid in an emergency. For example, if a customer started choking on some food in the restaurant, a member of staff should be able to help them until medical assistance arrives.</p>
