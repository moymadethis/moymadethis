						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Review options for hospitality and catering provision</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>When you are asked to propose a new hospitality and catering provision, the first thing you will need to do is review the potential options that are available – these options will depend on the information that is given to you regarding the location of the new provision, members of its local community, the owner of the business and what their goals are for the business.</p>
					<p>Everything you have learned about the hospitality and catering industry throughout this Unit can help you to identify and review your options.</p>

									<h2>Hospitality and catering organisations</h2>
									<p>In Session 1 of this Unit, we explored many different types of hospitality and catering businesses – including commercial, non-commercial, residential and non-residential businesses. For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Bars</li>
										<li>Restaurants</li>
										<li>Fast food/takeaway outlets</li>
										<li>Cafes</li>
										<li>Hotels</li>
										<li>Guest houses</li>
										<li>Tourist attractions</li>
										<li>Campsites</li>
										<li>Caravan parks</li>
									</ul>
									<p>When reviewing your options for a new hospitality and catering provision, the first thing to consider is what type of business it could be. For example, if the opportunity is to set up a new provision in a small unit on an industrial estate, then this automatically rules out options such as hotels, campsites, caravan parks, tourist attractions and so on – a café or fast food outlet would be more suitable options. However, if a grand old building in a town centre was available, then this could really suit the establishment of a hotel or fine dining restaurant.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Supply and demand</h2>
									<p>In Session 2 of this Unit, you learned about the impact that supply and demand can have on hospitality and catering businesses. When considering options for a new provision, you would need to consider:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The type of staff that will be needed in the provision and if staff with the right skills are likely to be available</li>
										<li>Whether the provision is likely to be affected by seasonal changes in demand</li>
										<li>If the location of the provision has any potential advantages/disadvantages (in terms of access to customers, staff, transport links, suppliers, etc)</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Employment contracts and working conditions</h2>
									<p>The owner of the new provision will need to be aware of different employment contracts that may be offered to staff, as well as key legislation relating to aspects of employment (such as working hours, pay and holiday entitlement).</p>
									<p>You learned about employment contracts and working conditions in Session 2 of this Unit.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Factors affecting the hospitality and catering industry</h2>
									<p>In Session of this Unit, you learned about a wide range of factors that can potentially impact the success of a hospitality/catering business. When reviewing options for your new provision, you will need to consider which of these factors may have an effect on the success of the chosen business.</p>
									<p>These factors include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Costs</li>
										<li>Profitability</li>
										<li>Customer trends and preferences (including technology, international travel, health, sustainability and innovative cooking techniques)</li>
										<li>Customer demographics and lifestyle</li>
										<li>Customer needs</li>
										<li>Media influences</li>
										<li>External influences (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Competition is also a factor that needs to be considered – for example, if there are already a number of hotels in a small town, then proposing another hotel as your new provision probably wouldn’t be the best option…instead, it would be better to consider a provision that isn’t already available in the area which could generate more business as there are potentially more customers to attract.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Kitchen and front of house operations</h2>
									<p>In Sessions 4 and 5 of this Unit, you explored kitchen and front of house operations – including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The way in which work flows</li>
										<li>Staff requirements</li>
										<li>Equipment that is used</li>
										<li>Health, safety and security considerations</li>
										<li>Dress code</li>
										<li>Stock control</li>
										<li>Documentation</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Depending on the type of provision you propose, you may need to consider and address some or all of these operational activities.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Customer requirements</h2>
									<p>In Session 6, you learned about different customer types (leisure, business, local) and the different needs and expectations that these customers have. When proposing a new provision, you will need to think about the type of customer the provision will attract and what the provision will need to do to ensure it meets the needs and expectations of these customers.</p>
									<p>You also learned about specific customer rights (such as equality, provision of quality goods/services, etc). This is something that the new provision will need to address, so that it operates within the law and avoids any penalties or fines.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Health and safety requirements</h2>
									<p>In Session 7 of this Unit, you learned all about key aspects of health and safety that are relevant in hospitality and catering businesses. This includes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Employer and employee responsibilities for health and safety (set out in key legislation such as the Health and Safety at Work Act, RIDDOR, COSHH, Manual Handling Operations and PPE at Work Regulations)</li>
										<li>Identifying risks and hazards in the workplace</li>
										<li>Common risks in hospitality and catering organisations (slips, trips, cuts, burns, personal health risks, electrical hazards, fire hazards)</li>
										<li>Security risks in hospitality/catering</li>
										<li>Suitable safety control measures</li>
									</ul>
									<p>All of these health, safety and security risks must be considered when setting up a new provision in order to make sure that the business is a safe place for staff and visitors.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Food-related health issues</h2>
									<p>In Session 8 of this Unit, we explored the different ways in which food can cause ill health and precautions that can be taken to control and minimise these risks.</p>
									<p>You learned about:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Safe and hygienic working practices</li>
										<li>Different types of bacteria</li>
										<li>How to prevent the spread of bacteria</li>
										<li>Signs and symptoms of food-related ill health</li>
										<li>Food allergies and intolerances</li>
										<li>Precautions that can be taken when preparing and serving food for people with food allergies/intolerances</li>
										<li>Food safety legislation that must be adhered to</li>
									</ul>
									<p>These aspects must be considered by any provision that will be handling/serving food to the public.</p>
