						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Describe food safety legislation</li>
							<li>Describe the role and responsibilities of the Environmental Health Officer (EHO)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>

					<p>As you have learned so far in this Session, it is extremely important for any catering organisation to ensure safe and hygienic practices in all food preparation and cooking activities. The consequences of bacteria causing food poisoning or allergens being inadvertently served to customers with allergies/intolerances can be severe and can have a serious impact on the reputation and popularity of the business...it could even lead to the closure of the business!</p>
					<p>For this reason, there are key pieces of food safety legislation in place for hospitality and catering organisations to adhere to. We will take a look at this legislation now.</p>

						<h3>The Food Safety Act 1990</h3>
						<p>This Act provides the framework for all food legislation in Britain and covers all types of food business in England, Wales and Scotland. It places the responsibility for safe food on staff working at each stage of production – including farming, harvesting, manufacturing, processing, handling, storing, supplying, preparing and cooking.</p>
						<p>Under this Act, all food businesses must ensure that:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Nothing is included or removed from food that would damage the health of people eating it</li>
							<li>Food is not treated in any way that would damage the health of people eating it</li>
							<li>All food that is served or sold is of the nature, substance or quality that consumers would expect</li>
							<li>Food is advertised, labelled and presented in a way that is not false or misleading</li>
							<li>All food handlers carry out training in basic food hygiene</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It is an offence to supply or serve any food that fails to comply with these food safety requirements.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="food-safety-regulations" class="hide">
						<h3>The Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations</h3>
						<p>These regulations were put in place under the Food Safety Act 1990 and relate to the hygiene of all foodstuffs (including food, drink and ingredients) at all stages of food production (apart from primary food production, such as harvesting, slaughtering or milking).</p>
						<p>Anyone who owns, manages or works in a food business (apart from those working in primary food production) is affected by these regulations – whether it is a burger van, a five-star hotel, a vending machine company, a small café in a museum, a cruise ship buffet restaurant, etc.</p>
						<p>All owners (proprietors) of food businesses must:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Make sure that food is supplied/sold in a hygienic way</li>
							<li>Identify food safety hazards</li>
							<li>Know which steps in their processes are critical for ensuring food safety</li>
							<li>Ensure that appropriate safety control are in place, maintained and reviewed</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In England, Scotland and Wales, these regulations have been replaced by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Food Hygiene (England) Regulations</li>
							<li>The Food Hygiene (Scotland) Regulations</li>
							<li>The Food Hygiene (Wales) Regulations</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="food-labelling-regulations" class="hide">
						<h3>Food Labelling Regulations</h3>
						<p>By law, labelling on pre-packed foods must include the following information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The name of the food</li>
							<li>The ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date (or instructions on where to find it)</li>
							<li>Appropriate warnings, if certain ingredients are present in the food</li>
							<li>A list of ingredients (and a quantitative ingredients declaration (QUID) if necessary)</li>
							<li>Whether the food contains any of the 14 specified allergens – these are peanuts, nuts from trees, fish, molluscs, crustaceans, cereals containing gluten, celery and celeriac, milk, eggs, soya, mustard, sesame seeds, sulphur dioxide and sulphites, lupin</li>
							<li>The weight or volume of the food (known as ‘net quantity’)</li>
							<li>The name and address of the manufacturer, packer or seller</li>
							<li>The country of origin, if required</li>
							<li>Any special storage conditions</li>
							<li>Instructions for use or cooking, if necessary</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you run a catering business, sell food loose or package it for sale in a shop, food labels only need to display the following information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The name of the food</li>
							<li>If any of the ingredients have been irradiated or have come from genetically modified sources</li>
							<li>Certain warnings if the food contains sweeteners, sugars, aspartame, colourings, liquorice, caffeine or polyols</li>
							<li>Any food additives that have been added</li>
							<li>Allergen information</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="food-composition-regulations" class="hide">
						<h3>Food Composition Regulations</h3>
						<p>These regulations specify what ingredients can and cannot be used in the manufacturing of foods.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="food-safety-act-regulations" class="hide">
						<h3>The Food Safety Act (Temperature Control) Regulations</h3>
						<p>These regulations set out the specific temperatures at which food must be stored or held. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Frozen food from -18°C to -24°C</li>
							<li>Chilled food from 3°C to 8°C</li>
							<li>Cooked food, core temperature at 75°C or above</li>
							<li>Hot holding at 63°C or above</li>
						</ul>

						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) provides hygiene ratings to businesses which serve food. This is no reflection on the quality of the food, only on the standards of food hygiene found on the date of inspection by the local authority. The ratings run from 0 to 5:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>0 = Urgent Improvement Necessary</li>
							<li>1 = Major Improvement Necessary</li>
							<li>2 = Improvement Necessary</li>
							<li>3 = Generally Satisfactory</li>
							<li>4 = Good</li>
							<li>5 = Very Good</li>
