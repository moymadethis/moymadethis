					</div>
					<p>On the previous page, you learned about the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system.</p>
					<p>A critical control point is a point, step or procedure in a food manufacturing/handling process at which control can be applied in order to prevent, eliminate or reduce a food safety hazard. If any of these points, steps or procedures are not done correctly, they can lead to outbreaks of food-related illnesses (food poisoning, etc).</p>
					<div class="boxout think-first">
						<h2 class="think-first__title">Think first</h2>
						<p>Can you think of any food handling processes that could be a critical control point? Type some ideas in the box below and state why you think these ideas would be classed as a critical control point (what could go wrong if they are not done properly)?</p>

						<h2>Examples of critical control points</h2>
						<p>The following steps are all examples of critical control points:</p>
						<ol class="list-numbers">
							<li>Cooking – Control measures are necessary to deal with the hazard of pathogens surviving the cooking process (for example, making sure that meat is cooked at the right temperature for the correct amount of time). Checking the temperature of cooked meat is also important, to make sure that the meat has reached a temperature where any bacteria present in the food will have been completely killed. The use of a <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">temperature probe</a> is useful here.</li>
							<li>Cooling – If you are cooking a food in advance and storing it before serving it, then it must be cooled correctly in order to prevent bacteria growing on it. For example, when cooking rice, it must be either eaten immediately or cooled quickly and then stored in the fridge. If it is left at room temperature, then bacteria can start growing and multiplying very quickly. Control measures will outline procedures for cooling of food for storage.</li>
							<li>Reheating – As with cooking, reheating food must be subject to control measures in order to make sure that food is reheated at the right temperature for a sufficient amount of time (the food needs to be piping hot all the way through before it can be considered safe to eat and food must only be reheated once).</li>
							<li>Storing – Certain foods need to be kept chilled to prevent the growth of food poisoning bacteria. Control measures are necessary to make sure that chilled foods are stored at the correct temperature (it is recommended that fridges are set at 5°C or below, and they must not be over-filled so that the cold air is able to circulate properly).</li>
							<li>Defrosting – Food poisoning bacteria can grow in food that is not defrosted properly before cooking. If food is still frozen (or partially frozen) when you begin cooking, the outside of the food will appear cooked, but the centre of the food may not be (meaning that it could contain food poisoning bacteria). Control measures are necessary to make sure that food is defrosted safely, in the right conditions and at the right temperature. Checks will need to be made to ensure food is defrosted thoroughly before being cooked.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>A good way to decide if a step or process would be classed as a critical control point is to ask yourself: <em>“At this step in my food preparation, could the food become contaminated in any way and/or could contamination increase?”</em></p>
