						<h1 class="hgroup__title">The Environmental Health Officer (EHO)</h1>
					</div>
					<p>As well as food businesses taking actions to ensure their compliance with food safety legislation and making sure that instances of food-related ill health are avoided, the Environmental Health Officer (EHO) plays an important role in monitoring and maintaining food safety standards.</p>
					<p>The role of the EHO is to implement and enforce many food safety and environmental health laws (many of which we looked at on page 10 of this Session). When visiting and inspecting a food business, the EHO will check that the business has good food safety and hygiene standards and is operating in line with these laws and regulations. Following inspection, the EHO will award the premises with a food hygiene rating, which must be displayed in public view at all times. <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about food hygiene ratings.</p>
					<p>A visit from an EHO may be planned or unplanned!</p>
					<p>In addition to this, the EHO will also look at:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Staff – Are they properly dressed, clean, hygienic no jewellery, hair covered/tied back, etc.</li>
						<li>Processes – Are effective processes in place for handling food (for example, use of colour coded boards, effective waste disposal, cleaning, washing up, etc)</li>
						<li>Food storage – Are food storage areas (fridges, freezers, etc) kept at the correct temperature? Are they clean and hygienic?</li>
						<li>Equipment – Is it clean, well maintained, stored correctly, used correctly, etc?</li>
						<li>Temperature of food – The EHO will use temperature probes to check the temperature of food that is stored, prepared and served.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>They will check every aspect of the food business and its operations, in order to make sure that food is safe and it will not cause food-related ill health in customers.</p>
					<p>As well as routine visits and inspections, an EHO will also carry out a specific set of responsibilities in order to investigate complaints made about a food business and its standard of food safety or if there is an outbreak of food poisoning.</p>
					<p>In these cases, the EHO will follow up the complaint or outbreak by visiting the food business and carrying out a series of checks. They would also collect samples from the food business so that they could be tested in order to identify the possible source of the complaint or outbreak (they may also take photographs in order to collect evidence for their inspection).</p>
					<p>During this process, an important part of the EHO’s job is to maintain clear and accurate records and evidence of the investigation work they carry out. They will have to write and submit reports on the work that they carry out and their findings.</p>
					<p>Depending on the severity of the complaint or outbreak, the EHO may also be called upon to give evidence in court if any prosecution is made against the food business.</p>
