						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Potential risks and hazards</h1>
					</div>
					<p>There are many ways in which food can cause ill health and it is important to be aware of hazards that may lead to this happening. If catering staff are able to identify potential risks in the cooking environment, then hazards leading to ill health can be reduced and avoided.</p>
					<p>A <strong>hazard</strong> is anything that can be a danger or a risk to you or others around you. For example, a spillage on the floor, rotten food in fridges, bin overflowing.</p>
					<p>A <strong>risk</strong> is the chance (high or low) that a hazard will actually cause somebody harm.</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to learn more about the <strong>different types of hazards</strong> that may occur in the cooking environment, and how they can potentially lead to ill health.</p>
					<div class="flexslider-wrap">
						<div class="flexslider">
							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Physical contamination</h2>
									<p>The risk of physical contamination during the cooking process comes from physical materials in and around the cooking environment, such as leaves or stalks from fruit and vegetables, egg shells, hairs, nails, plasters, debris from the building (dust, etc), debris from equipment (bits of old food, peeling paint/plastic, etc) or debris from packaging (small pieces of film, foil, pieces of metal from tinned foods, etc). It can also include allergens such as gluten, nuts, celery and mustard inadvertently getting into dishes from equipment and work surfaces.</p>
									<p>Where possible, food should be kept covered to stop things falling into it.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Chemical contamination</h2>
									<p>The risk of chemical contamination may come from:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Cleaning fluids used in and around the cooking environment</li>
										<li>Ingredients such as fruit and vegetables that are covered in <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">pesticides</a> or <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">fertiliser</a> and not washed properly before use</li>
										<li>Pest control products that may be used in and around the cooking environment</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Cleaning chemicals must always be stored separately, well away from food, and should only be used in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. Only food safe cleaning products should be used in any catering environment.</p>
									<p>Chemical contamination may also occur in food sources – for example, metals such as lead and mercury may be found in fish caught in contaminated water. This can then pass to humans if they eat the contaminated fish. Similarly, if poisonous plants (such as berries and mushrooms/toadstools) are used in cooking or come into contact with other ingredients being used, they can contaminate dishes that are served to customers. Animals may also be injected with growth hormones or antibiotics, in order to produce more meat or bi-products such as milk. These chemicals can cause harm in humans if consumed in the food that they eat.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Biological contamination</h2>
									<p>The risk of biological contamination comes from pathogenic (food poisoning) bacteria; therefore it is anything that allows bacteria to get on or into food and grow – for example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Coughing and sneezing – germs travel from our body onto the food</li>
										<li>Handling raw meat and then cooked foods, which spreads bacteria</li>
										<li>Bacterial growth in high risk foods – you will learn more about high risk foods shortly</li>
										<li>Food spoilage – this is when microbes grow and multiply on food, causing it to ‘go off’ and become unsuitable for consumption</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Bacteria includes e-coli, salmonella and staphylococcus – you’ll learn more about different types of bacteria later in this Session.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Cross-contamination</h2>
									<p>When bacteria is allowed to spread within the cooking environment, this is referred to as ‘cross-contamination’. Bacteria can be spread through:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Unwashed clothing</li>
										<li>Using the same utensils and equipment for raw and cooked foods</li>
										<li>Poor personal hygiene (dirty hands, fingernails, etc)</li>
										<li>Poor waste control – Waste can be any item of food, ingredients, packaging or dirty cloths that are no longer suitable for use and need to be thrown away. If waste is not handled properly in the cooking environment, it can present a risk of cross-contamination (for example, bacteria from out of date or rotting food can spread to other foods – it can also attract pests to the kitchen). Effective waste control involves regularly and promptly disposing of food waste and other waste from food preparation areas. Waste bins should be positioned conveniently around the cooking environment so that they may be accessed easily. Pedal bins are preferable as they don’t need to be touched with hands when disposing of waste.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Bacteria entering food and causing illness</h2>
									<p>Bacteria can enter food and cause cross-contamination in many different ways. To avoid this risk, catering staff can take the following actions:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Always wear clean clothes and a clean apron</li>
										<li>Follow effective handwashing techniques at all times and especially after activities that have a high risk of potentially causing contamination (for example, coughing or sneezing, handling raw meat, touching bins or waste)</li>
										<li>Always keep raw and cooked food separate</li>
										<li>Use separate utensils and equipment (chopping boards, knives, etc) for working with raw and cooked food</li>
										<li>Take care with the way in which high risk foods are stored/handled</li>
										<li>Look out for signs of food spoilage</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Food spoilage</h2>
									<p>Microbes are all around us – in the air, soil, water and our bodies – and they can very easily find their way into our food. In the right conditions, these microbes can multiply very quickly. When certain microbes grow on food, it can cause the food to spoil or ‘go off’ – it may begin to smell unpleasant, soften, change colour, become covered in fur, etc. When bacterial microbes are present in food, they cause it to spoil – however, there can also be pathogenic microbes and these are more dangerous and have the potential to cause diseases.</p>
									<p>There are three main types of microbes that cause spoilage – these are:</p>
									<ol class="list-numbers">
										<li>Bacteria – Bacteria prefer moist conditions and can live in a wide range of temperatures. In the right conditions of warmth and moisture, bacteria can multiply very quickly.</li>
										<li>Yeasts – Yeasts are single celled fungi which can reproduce by ‘budding’ (which means that a small bud separates from the main cell allowing the fungi to grow and spread). In warm, moist conditions in the presence of sugar, yeasts will cause food to spoil (especially fruits, due to their sugar content).</li>
										<li>Moulds – Moulds are also fungi, which grow as filaments in food. Moulds reproduce by producing spores in fruiting bodies which can be seen on the surface of foods. These fruiting bodies sometimes look like round, blue, furry growths on food (for example, mould growing on bread that has spoiled/gone off).</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Food spoilage can be minimised by taking the following actions:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Store fruit and vegetables separately in tightly sealed containers</li>
										<li>In refrigerators, store meats, cheeses and vegetables separately</li>
										<li>Check refrigerated foods every – If one food has started to spoil, remove it immediately so that the spoilage bacteria can not spread and contaminate other foods</li>
										<li>Set fridge temperatures at 5°C or below – This will prevent pathogenic bacteria from growing and spreading. Use a thermometer in your fridge to monitor the temperature.</li>
										<li>Keep shelves inside the refrigerator clean to prevent the growth of mould.</li>
										<li>Keep certain food separate – Some fruits, such as apples, peaches and bananas, release a gas called ethylene when they ripen and, when too much of this gas is released, it will cause spoilage. By keeping foods that release ethylene away from foods that don’t, it can help to prevent spoilage.</li>
									</ul>

							<dt>Pesticides</dt>
							<dd>Plants and crops can be sprayed with pesticides in order to prevent them being eaten by insects. If humans are exposed to these chemicals in large amounts, they can cause dizziness, headaches, skin irritation, nausea, vomiting and possibly some cancers.</dd>
							<dt>Fertilisers</dt>
							<dd>Plants and crops are sprayed with fertiliser to help them to grow bigger. Some fertilisers contain chemicals such as nitrates, phosphates and potassium – these are all toxic to humans.</dd>
							<dt>Microbes</dt>
