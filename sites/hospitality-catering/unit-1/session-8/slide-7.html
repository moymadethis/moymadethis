					<p>Now click through the slide panel below to recap some of the key actions that you can take to minimise risks in the cooking environment.</p>
					<div class="flexslider-wrap">
						<div class="flexslider">
							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Use of colour coding</h2>
									<p>The use of colour coding in the kitchen is an important part of minimising the risk of food contamination. For example, different coloured knives, chopping boards and other utensils/pieces of equipment can be used for working with different types of food in order to keep ingredients separate and avoid cross-contamination. The colour coding system makes it easy to identify which items should be used for particular tasks.</p>
									<p>Take a look at the diagram below to see the recommended colour coding to be used for different foods:</p>
									
									[DIAGRAM NEEDED]
									
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Safe temperature control during storage of food</h2>
									<p>The following steps can control food temperatures and prevent contamination during storage of food:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Store chilled food in a refrigerator</li>
										<li>Place chilled food as quickly as possible in a fridge</li>
										<li>Place frozen food as quickly as possible in a freezer
										<li>Hot food should be chilled as quickly as possible before being </li>stored in the fridge</li>
										<li>Never put hot food in a fridge – this can increase the temperature inside the fridge, potentially causing other food items in the fridge to become too warm and at risk of bacterial growth</li>
										<li>All refrigerators should be kept at between 1°C and 5°C</li>
										<li>Freezers should be kept at below -18°C – freezing food at this temperature will prevent bacteria multiplying</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Safe temperature control when reheating food</h2>
									<p>It is very important to reheat food properly, in order to kill harmful bacteria that may have grown since the food was cooked. The following steps can control food temperatures and prevent contamination when reheating food:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Use equipment suitable for reheating (such as ovens, grills, microwaves) – if equipment is not suitable for reheating, the food might not get hot enough to kill the bacteria</li>
										<li>Preheat equipment such as ovens and grills before reheating – if equipment is used before it has preheated, the food will take longer to reheat and it can be difficult to judge timings, etc (recommended reheating times may not be accurate)</li>
										<li>Only reheat food once</li>
										<li>If using a microwave, ensure you stir the food during the reheating – this will help to make sure that the food is being evenly and thoroughly reheated</li>
										<li>Never reheat food that is over 24 hours old</li>
										<li>All food should be reheated to a minimum of 75°C for 2 minutes to kill harmful bacteria</li>
										<li>Use a temperature probe to make sure the centre of the food has reached the correct temperature</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Safe temperature control during serving of hot and cold food</h2>
									<p>Effective temperature control is important when serving hot and cold food, as it controls the growth of bacteria.</p>
									<p>For example, when serving hot food, it must be kept at temperatures above 63°C at all times, as this will control the multiplication of bacteria. If hot food is being held prior to serving, it must be kept at above this temperature and placed in appropriate equipment, such as a pre-heated cabinet, as soon as possible after cooking or reheating.</p>
									<p>When serving cold food, it should be kept chilled or refrigerated at 5°C or below until it is ready to be served/consumed.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Hand washing</h2>
									<p>Remember that dirty hands spread bacteria and contaminate food, therefore effective hand washing is essential and it should be done:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Before handling food</li>
										<li>After handling raw food or packaging of raw food</li>
										<li>After using the toilet</li>
										<li>After touching bins or waste</li>
										<li>After blowing your nose</li>
										<li>After eating or drinking</li>
										<li>After touching your ears, nose and/or mouth</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The key steps to following when handwashing are:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Wet your hands under warm running water and apply liquid soap.
										<li>Rub palms together to form a lather.
										<li>Rub one palm along the back of the other hand and then along the fingers. Repeat with the other hand.</li>
										<li>Rub palms together again, this time with fingers interlaced, rubbing thoroughly in between each finger.</li>
										<li>Rub the back of the fingers with the opposite palm, with fingers interlaced. Repeat with the other hand.</li>
										<li>Clasp the thumb in the palm of the opposite hand and rotate. Repeat with the other hand.</li>
										<li>Rub backwards and forwards over palm with clasped fingers. Repeat with the other hand.</li>
										<li>Rinse soap off with clean warm water.</li>
										<li>Dry hands using a paper towel.</li>
										<li>Use the paper towel to turn off the tap, so that clean hands don’t come into contact with the taps, then throw the paper towel away.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Pest control</h2>
									<p>Pest control is important in the cooking environment as pests can carry food poisoning bacteria which can spread and contaminate food, causing illness and/or food spoilage. These food poisoning bacteria can be passed from the pests to the food through contact with their hair, faeces (poo) and urine. Pests in the kitchen can also pose the risk of physical contamination in food.</p>
									<p>Pests are any animals, birds or insects that bring a risk of food contamination, either directly or indirectly. Take a look at the table below to see examples of different pests and some signs you can look out for to spot pest problems.</p>
									<table class="table-solid">

									<p>Key pest control steps that can be taken include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Sealing holes, and other places where pests may gain access</li>
										<li>Fitting drain covers to prevent pests gaining access</li>
										<li>Fitting insect screens on windows that open directly into food preparation areas</li>
										<li>Managing the cooking environment and waste disposal areas to make sure they are kept clean and protected against pests</li>
										<li>Keeping food covered when it is waiting to be prepared, being defrosted or being cooled</li>
										<li>Removing food waste regularly from the cooking environment</li>
										<li>Checking the cooking environment regularly for signs of pests, such as droppings, eggs and dead insects</li>
										<li>Perhaps using a pest control company to monitor the cooking environment on a regular basis – this company will check for the presence of pests, monitor any pest proofing that is in place and take action to eradicate any pests that are found</li>
