						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)</h1>
					</div>
					<p>Hospitality and catering businesses can make sure that they comply with food safety legislation by applying certain controls – for example, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system and risk assessments.</p>
					<p>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a system that can be used to ensure food safety from biological, chemical and physical hazards – in particular, food business operators will use HACCP to investigate the way in which they prepare, produce, handle and package food and introduce procedures to make sure that the food they handle/produce is safe to eat.</p>
					<p>HACCP is made up of <strong>seven key principles</strong>, which provide a systematic way of identifying and controlling food safety hazards through critical control points, making sure that they are being managed appropriately and continuously.</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to explore these principles in more detail.</p>

								<li>
									<h2>Identify hazards that must be prevented, eliminated or reduced (what could go wrong?)</h2>
									<p>At this stage, you need to inspect the environment to identify food safety hazards, the level of risk presented by these hazards and preventive measures that can be applied to control these hazards. Remember that a food safety hazard is any potential biological, chemical, or physical contamination that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Identify critical control points (CCPs) to prevent or eliminate a hazard</h2>
									<p>A critical control point is a point, step or procedure in a food manufacturing/handling process at which control can be applied in order to prevent, eliminate or reduce a food safety hazard.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Establish critical limits for each critical control point</h2>
									<p>A critical limit is the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical hazard must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce that hazard to an acceptable level (for example, cooking times, temperatures, etc).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Establish and implement effective monitoring procedures at CCPs</h2>
									<p>Monitoring procedures need to be implemented to check that critical control points are controlling the identified hazards. For example, if a control is based on temperature levels then you may action temperature checks and use monitoring forms to record times that these observations have been carried out and the information that was recorded.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Establish corrective actions (what to do if something goes wrong)</h2>
									<p>If the monitoring process shows that CCPs are not under control (there is a deviation from a critical limit), then corrective actions need to be taken. For example, if the fridge temperature becomes too high then you might relocate food to a fridge at the correct temperature, call an engineer or contact a manager.</p>
									<p>Corrective actions are intended to ensure that no product will cause harm, injury or danger to health.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Establish procedures for ensuring the HACCP system is working as intended</h2>
									<p>Validation procedures will check that HACCP plans are adequate and working as intended. These procedures may include activities such as reviewing HACCP plans, checking CCP records, monitoring critical limits and carrying out microbial sampling/analysis.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Establish appropriate record keeping procedures</h2>
									<p>The HACCP regulation requires that all food businesses keep certain records/documents, including hazard analysis, written HACCP plans, documentation showing records of the monitoring of critical control points, critical limits, verification activities, and the handling of any deviations from critical limits. This helps to ensure that the system is working correctly and everyone is taking responsibility for food safety.</p>

						<h2>Supporting HACCP plans</h2>
						<p>The following preventative measures may be taken to support HACCP plans in food businesses:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Staff training on the subject of identifying and reporting potential food safety hazards</li>
							<li>Use of colour coding in food preparation areas</li>
							<li>Making sure that food is labelled and stored correctly, with dates clearly marked on</li>
							<li>Regular visual checks on food products (particularly refrigerated items), looking out for signs of spoilage</li>
							<li>Cleaning/sanitising all surfaces after preparing and handling foods</li>
							<li>Checking that food storage temperatures are maintained at the correct (safe) level</li>
							<li>Separating raw and cooked ingredients (meat/fish in particular) to prevent cross contamination</li>
