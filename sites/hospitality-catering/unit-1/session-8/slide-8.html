						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Food-related health conditions</h1>
					</div>
					<p>As well as food poisoning caused by the spread of bacteria during the food preparation/cooking process, people can also suffer from ongoing food-related health conditions – for example, they may have food <strong>allergies</strong> or an <strong>intolerance</strong> to certain ingredients. When a catering organisation is preparing and cooking meals for other people, it is very important to be aware of any food-related health conditions that customers may have – this will help them to avoid including any potentially dangerous ingredients in the dishes being served to customers.</p>
					<p>If a person has a food allergy or food intolerance, it means that their body reacts badly when they eat a certain food. A food allergy causes a reaction that can affect many parts/organs in the body and can cause a range of symptoms. In some cases, these symptoms can be severe or life-threatening. In contrast, food intolerance symptoms tend to be less serious and particularly related to the body’s digestive system.</p>
					<p>Even though the symptoms of food intolerance can be less severe, having a food intolerance can have a big impact on a person’s quality of life. The unpleasant symptoms that can be triggered by food intolerance can last for several days, making it difficult for the person to get on with their daily life. A food intolerance can be difficult to diagnose and identifying the source of the intolerance can take a long time, during which the person must live with the symptoms…not always knowing what is causing them to be unwell. It can also impact on the social aspect of a person’s life – they may find it difficult to enjoy going out to eat in restaurants in case something triggers their intolerance.</p>

						<h3>Food allergy</h3>
						<p>An allergic reaction to food takes place when your immune system thinks that a certain food (or foods) are a threat to your body. In these circumstances, your body’s reaction can range from mild to very severe and can affect different areas of the body. For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A reaction can occur within seconds, minutes or hours</li>
							<li>A reaction will typically be triggered by eating a certain food – however, someone suffering with a severe food allergy may have a reaction to simply touching a certain food or inhaling particles of it in the air</li>
							<li>A reaction can affect one or many areas of the body – symptoms include skin rashes, swelling of lips, eyes and face, a runny nose, itchy skin and eyes, a tight chest, wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath.</li>
							<li>A life-threatening allergic reaction causes the body to go into anaphylactic shock – this is where the throat swells up, making it difficult for the person to breathe or speak. If a severe allergic reaction is not treated urgently, the person may collapse and require resuscitation.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div id="intolerance" class="hide">
						<h3>Food intolerance</h3>
						<p>Unlike food allergies, a food intolerance is not linked to your body’s immune system – it is caused when your body finds it difficult to digest certain ingredients from the food you eat. Common food intolerances include lactose (from milk/dairy) and gluten (from wheat, used in bread, pasta, etc). If someone eats a food or ingredient that they are intolerant to, they may develop symptoms such as a bloated stomach, stomach cramps, wind, diarrhoea and nausea. These symptoms will occur several hours after eating the food, and while they can be severe, they are not life threatening.</p>
						<p>Coeliac disease combines symptoms of both food allergy and food intolerance. This is because coeliac disease is an <strong>intolerance</strong> to gluten, however it is caused because of the way the body’s <strong>immune system</strong> reacts to gluten in the diet. Symptoms of coeliac disease are similar to other food intolerances (bloating, diarrhoea, etc), but other symptoms may also be present, such as mouth ulcers, tiredness and anaemia.</p>
					</div>
					<!-- END FANCYBOX (hidden) CONTENT -->
					<p>The following foods are most commonly known to cause allergic reactions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Peanuts</li>
						<li>Tree nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, brazil nuts and pecans</li>
						<li>Fish and shellfish, such as prawns and shrimps</li>
						<li>Soya</li>
						<li>Wheat and other grains containing gluten (such as barley and oats)</li>
						<li>Eggs</li>
						<li>Milk</li>
						<li>Celery and celeriac</li>
						<li>Mustard</li>
						<li>Sesame seeds</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Some of these foods, such as wheat and milk, are commonly found as ingredients of food (such as bread and pasta), so it is important for catering staff to make sure they know the exact ingredients of food being served to customers.</p>
					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>There are many alternative food items available for those people suffering food intolerances.</p>
						<p>For people with Coeliac disease, there is a wide range of gluten-free products available in supermarkets (including gluten-free bread, pasta, biscuits and cereals).</p>
						<p>For people suffering from lactose intolerance, they can choose lacto free milk products instead of cow’s milk (such as soya milk, almond milk, coconut milk, rice milk or oat milk). Similarly, alternatives to cheese would include lacto free cheese or dairy free cheese. Some people who are lactose intolerant find it easier to tolerate milk from other animals (which means that they may be able to eat goat’s cheese or mozzarella – made from buffalo milk – without experiencing any symptoms). Also, when a cheese has been aged (allowed to ripen), this process can break down the lactose in the cheese making it more suitable for people with lactose intolerance. Examples include Parmesan cheese and Swiss cheese. In contrast to this, fresh, unripened cheese such as cream cheese, cottage cheese and ricotta, are not aged and therefore can contain more lactose than aged cheeses.</p>
