						<h2 class="assessment__title">Preparing for your assessment</h2>
						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Describe common types of food poisoning</li>
							<li>Describe the symptoms of food induced ill health</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Before you move on to learn more about the spread of bacteria, click through the slide panel below to explore some of the different types of bacteria which can cause food poisoning and the typical signs/symptoms of illness that may be caused.</p>

								<li>
									<h2>E-coli</h2>
									<p>Escherichia coli (E-coli) is a type of bacteria commonly found in human and animal intestines. There are many different types of E-coli – most are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning and infection. Some types of E-coli can cause gastrointestinal infections and the common mode of infection is by eating food that is contaminated with E-coli bacteria. Examples of foods where E-coli may be present include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Raw leafy vegetables (that have not been washed)</li>
										<li>Raw or undercooked meat</li>
										<li>Raw milk products</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Symptoms of E-coli depend on the site of the infection and the type of E-coli that is causing the infection. Symptoms can take between 12 and 24 hours (or longer) to appear. Typical symptoms include stomach ache, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, cystitis (an infection of the bladder) and even kidney damage or failure in severe cases. Symptoms usually last for up to seven days, but can last longer and become more severe in some cases.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Salmonella</h2>
									<p>Salmonella is one of the most common type of bacteria which leads to food poisoning. The main sources of this bacteria are eggs and poultry so particular care should be taken when using these ingredients. Other foods where salmonella may be present include raw or undercooked meat, shellfish, unpasteurised milk and cheese and also contaminated raw fruits and vegetables.</p>
									<p>Symptoms of salmonella can appear between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Typical symptoms include stomach ache, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. Symptoms usually last for around 4 to 7 days.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Campylobacter</h2>
									<p>Campylobacter can also cause food poisoning and this can be found in raw meat, poultry and shellfish. It is important to ensure that all meats are cooked to a safe temperature. Meats should be cooked to an inner temperature of at least 70°C and held at this temperature for at least 2 minutes. This ensures that all bacteria has been “killed”.</p>
									<p>Symptoms of campylobacter can appear within 2 to 5 days after becoming infected, but can take as long as 10 days. Typical symptoms include stomach pains/cramps, fever, nausea and diarrhoea (which may be bloody). Symptoms usually last for around 7 days.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Clostridium perfringens</h2>
									<p>Clostridium perfringens is often found in foods that are kept warm for a long time before being served. These infections are usually linked to institutions (such as hospitals, school cafeterias, prisons and nursing homes) or events with catered food. This bacteria is often found in meats particularly beef and poultry, but also gravies, especially when made using the juices from the meat.</p>
									<p>Symptoms of clostridium perfringens can appear within a short time of becoming infected (often 12 to 24 hours). Typical symptoms include stomach ache and diarrhoea. Symptoms usually last for around 24 hours.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Staphylococcus aureus</h2>
									<p>Staphylococcus aureus is another type of bacteria. These bacteria are commonly found in the nose, throat and on the skin. Poor personal hygiene can easily spread the bacteria to food – for example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Sneezing over food</li>
										<li>Not washing hands after blowing your nose</li>
										<li>Coughing without covering your mouth and washing your hands</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Typical food sources of staphylococcus can include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Foods that involve hand contact during preparation and require no additional cooking – such as salads, bakery products, sandwiches, etc</li>
										<li>Milk and dairy products</li>
										<li>Meat and poultry</li>
										<li>Eggs and related products (such as mayonnaise)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Symptoms of staphylococcus aureus can appear very quickly (often 1 to 6 hours). Typical symptoms include stomach pain/cramp, vomiting and a low temperature. Symptoms typically last for around 24 hours.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Listeria</h2>
									<p>Listeria is a family of bacteria that contains ten different types (or species). One of these, listeria monocytogenes causes an illness in humans called listeriosis. Listeriosis is rare but can be very dangerous, and fatal in some cases. It can be particularly dangerous in older people, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems (such as new babies). Listeria can live in food products such as meat, milk, butter, cream, yoghurt and vegetables.</p>
									<p>The spread of listeria can be avoided by washing all fruit, vegetables and salad ingredients fully before serving, cooking food thoroughly and serving it immediately, storing food in the correct refrigerated temperatures and keeping cooked and raw food separate at all times.</p>
									<p>Symptoms of listeriosis can take weeks or even months to appear! Typical symptoms are often very similar to flu symptoms – a high temperature, aches and pains, chills, fever, nausea and diarrhoea. These symptoms may only last for a few days.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Bacillus cereus</h2>
									<p>This is a type of bacteria that produces toxins. These bacteria can be present in food and will multiply quickly at room temperature. The toxins they produce can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in humans. Common sources of bacillus cereus include rice, sauces, soups and other prepared foods that have been left out too long at room temperature (leftover food is also a common source of this bacteria).</p>
									<p>Symptoms of bacillus cereus can appear very quickly – often between 1 and 16 hours after infection. Typical symptoms are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. These symptoms may only last for a couple of days.</p>
