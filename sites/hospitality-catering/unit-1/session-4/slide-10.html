						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Dress Code</h1>
					</div>
					<p>As the work carried out in kitchens is a ‘backstage’ operation, the dress code exists more for reasons of health and safety, as opposed to presenting a positive, professional image to customers. Occasionally, a senior chef may go out into the dining area to talk with customers, but most kitchen staff will hardly ever be seen by customers.</p>
					<p>Typically, a chef would be expected to wear:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A chef’s hat or toque (with hair tied up where necessary)</li>
						<li>Clean, ironed chef whites with a buttoned-through top</li>
						<li>A clean, ironed white apron</li>
						<li>Chequered chef trousers</li>
						<li>Black non-slip backed shoes (no open-toed shoes)</li>
						<li>A neck chief</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Click here to see an image of a chef in uniform.</p>

					<p>A kitchen dress code will set out what kitchen staff are expected to wear during their shift and also what is expected of them when it comes to personal appearance and hygiene.</p>
					
					<div class="boxout think-first">
						<h2 class="think-first__title">Activity</h2>
						<p>Can you think of any examples of personal appearance/hygiene rules a member of kitchen staff would be expected to follow when they are at work? Type some ideas into the box below before you move on.</p>

						<h3>Personal appearance and hygiene</h3>
						<p>A kitchen’s dress code may specify the following personal appearance and hygiene requirements:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Begin each shift in a clean, neat uniform</li>
							<li>Do not wear the uniform when travelling to or from work</li>
							<li>Fingernails should be short, clean and well maintained; do not wear nail varnish or false nails (this can lead to a risk of contamination if dirt, varnish or nails were to fall into food)</li>
							<li>Keep hair clean and neat; long hair should be tied back and covered (this reduces the risk of loose hair falling into food or being burnt on hobs, ovens, etc)</li>
							<li>Avoid touching your hair and face when working with food</li>
							<li>Do not smoke or chew gum when working with food</li>
							<li>Do not wear jewellery (although a watch and a plain ring may sometimes be acceptable)</li>
							<li>Do not handle food when ill</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<!-- END FANCYBOX (hidden) CONTENT -->
					<p>Hygiene is very important in any kitchen, and the consequences of staff having poor hygiene practices can be very serious for an organisation (for example, if food becomes contaminated during the production/preparation process due to poor staff hygiene).</p>
					<p>The kitchen’s dress code is also important for maintaining the safety of staff working in the kitchen. For example, a chef’s uniform is designed specifically to protect their skin from being burned by hot food and liquids and non-slip shoes are worn to reduce the risk of slipping on wet floors or spillages. There may also be specific items of protective clothing that staff must wear when performing certain tasks in the kitchen – such as oven gloves when handling hot dishes, protective gloves when handling cleaning products containing potentially harmful chemicals or cut resistant gloves when boning meat or cutting large tough joints of meat.</p>
					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>Where an item of clothing is required for personal protection, this must be provided by the employer free of charge.</p>
