						<h2 class="assessment__title">Preparing for your assessment</h2>
						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Identify risks to personal safety in hospitality and catering</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>In order for employers (and employees) to effectively adhere to the various responsibilities we looked at on the previous page, they need to be able to identify risks in the workplace.</p>
					<p>By identifying <strong>risks</strong> (or potential risks), then employers and employees can take appropriate actions to reduce or remove the <strong>hazard</strong> that is the cause of the risk.</p>

						<h2>Risks and hazards</h2>
						<p>A hazard is anything that has the potential to cause danger or harm to you or others around you. Risk is the chance (high, medium or low) that a hazard will actually cause somebody harm.</p>
						<p>Let’s consider an example.</p>
						<p>If there was water spilled on a kitchen floor, this is a hazard with a high risk of causing someone to slip and fall. However, if a barrier is placed around the water, the hazard still exists, but the risk of someone slipping on it is reduced.</p>

					<!-- END FANCYBOX (hidden) CONTENT -->
					<p>There are many potential risks to personal health and safety when working in hospitality and catering. We will take a look at some of the main examples now. Click through the slide panel below.</p>

						<div class="flexslider">
							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Slips and trips</h2>
									<p>These are the most common cause of injury in UK workplaces. In hospitality and catering, this type of hazard is most likely to affect waiting staff, chefs and other kitchen workers (possibly also room attendants in hotels).</p>
									<p>Food and water spillages can be a common cause of slips, while trip hazards can include boxes, bags, chairs, electrical cables and uneven flooring. Floors can also become slippery during the cleaning process, for example when they have been mopped and are still wet. Wet floor caution signs can be used to warn people of the risk of slipping.</p>
									<p>Employees have a responsibility to clean up any spills immediately, so that they do not become a slip hazard (or report the spill to someone else and make others aware of the hazard so that they can avoid it until it is cleared away).</p>
									<p>It is important to remember that employers, employees, customers and suppliers may be at risk of slips and trips within a hospitality/catering organisation. Anyone passing through an area of the organisation where there are slip or trip hazards could be at risk. For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A hotel reception floor becomes wet on a rainy day – this poses a risk of slips to guests entering the hotel, receptionists and porters working in this area of the hotel and also delivery drivers bringing supplies to the hotel.</li>
										<li>A kitchen floor has water spilled on it – this poses a risk of slips to kitchen workers as well as waiting staff who come into the kitchen to collect meals for service. Suppliers may also enter the kitchen area to deliver goods. This spill poses little risk to customers, as they are not generally allowed into the kitchen area.</li>
										<li>A hotel room has recently been cleaned and the bathroom floor is still wet – this poses a risk to the guest (or guests) staying in the room and also to the room attendant who may still be cleaning the room.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Examples of control measures that could be applied to reduce these hazards include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Staff training/instruction</li>
										<li>Adequate housekeeping</li>
										<li>Ensuring work areas are well lit</li>
										<li>Ensuring work areas are clear of obstructions</li>
										<li>Spills to be cleaned up as soon as possible</li>
										<li>Wearing shoes with non-slip soles</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Cuts</h2>
									<p>Accidents involving knives are common in catering organisations. There are certain ‘Dos and Don’ts’ that can be applied in the workplace to minimise the risk of cuts. For example:</p>
									<h3>Do...</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Use a knife that is suitable for the job</li>
										<li>Keep knives sharp</li>
										<li>Handle knives carefully when carrying them and washing them up</li>
										<li>Always carry knives with the blade pointing downwards</li>
										<li>Always cut on a flat, stable work surface</li>
										<li>Store knives in a safe place, such as a knife block</li>
										<li>Make sure that appropriate training has been given relating to the safe use of knives</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Don't...</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Leave knives lying around on work surface or in washing up bowls</li>
										<li>Try to catch a falling knife</li>
										<li>Use a knife as a tin opener</li>
										<li>Carry knives in your pocket</li>
										<li>Try to carry a knife while also carrying other objects</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Examples of control measures that could be applied to reduce these hazards include:</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Staff training/instruction</li>
										<li>Supervision when using knives</li>
										<li>Knives stored in a secure place</li>
										<li>Knives to be sharpened regularly, as appropriate</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Burns</h2>
									<p>In a kitchen environment, staff will be handling hot equipment and food on a regular basis. This makes the risk of burns fairly high. All of the following hazards can present a risk of burns:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Hobs</li>
										<li>Ovens (including oven shelves and doors)</li>
										<li>Grills</li>
										<li>Hot plates</li>
										<li>Steam released from ovens or steam cookers</li>
										<li>Hot food</li>
										<li>Hot oil</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Some chemical substances can also cause burns when they come into contact with skin.</p>
									<p>Examples of control measures that could be applied to reduce these hazards include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Staff training/instruction on how to operate equipment safely where there may be a risk of burns (hot drinks machines, grills, fryers, etc)</li>
										<li>Oven/protective gloves to be used</li>
										<li>Oven gloves must be dry before use</li>
										<li>Care to be taken when using ovens and hobs</li>
										<li>Wear a protective apron when using grills and fryers</li>
										<li>Cover hot oil and grease when not in use</li>
										<li>Keep hair and clothes away from flames</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Personal health</h2>
									<p>One of the main risks to personal health at work is the development of a musculoskeletal disorder. This term relates to any disorder that can negatively affect a person’s muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments and nerves. For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Manual handling operations (lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling items) can lead to back pain</li>
										<li>Having poor posture whilst standing and carrying out a repetitive task (such as a chef preparing vegetables) can lead to problem in the neck, back and shoulders</li>
										<li>Having poor posture whilst sitting at a desk for long periods of time can also cause pain in the back, neck and shoulder areas</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Another health problem that can develop is dermatitis. This is a condition where the skin becomes red, itchy, swollen and blistered. It can be caused through contact with substances such as cleaning products, food and water. Where possible, gloves can be worn to protect the hands.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Electricity</h2>
									<p>Electrical equipment is all around us and you will find many examples in hospitality/catering organisations (for example, lights, ovens, hobs, computers, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, kettles, televisions and so on.</p>
									<p>Electricity and electrical items can be very dangerous if not used safely and correctly. Electrical equipment must also be checked regularly for faults or damage that could present a risk to users (for example, checking if the plug and cable are in good condition). Electrical equipment used in the workplace must also be inspected regularly (often on an annual basis). When this inspection takes place, the piece of equipment will be labelled to show the date of the inspection and the date when the next inspection will be due. If a piece of equipment has passed its due date for inspection, it should not be used as it may be unsafe.</p>
									<p>Minor electric shocks can cause burns, while more severe shocks (or electrocutions) can cause death. An electric shock may also cause someone to trip or fall, causing injury to themselves and/or others.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Fire</h2>
									<p>There can be a risk of fire in every organisation. Fire is very dangerous and can cause a lot of damage very quickly; serious fires can also be life threatening.</p>
									<p>The main fire risk in a hospitality or catering organisation will be in the kitchen areas.</p>
									<p>For a fire to start, three things are needed – these are:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Fuel – Any substance that burns can act as fuel for a fire (this includes gas, electricity, oil, fabric, wood, etc).</li>
										<li>Air – Oxygen from the air keeps a fire burning so, if the air is removed from a fire, it will go out. Covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the air and puts the fire out.</li>
										<li>Heat – Fire creates heat and, if heat is removed from a fire, it will go out (for example, many fire extinguishers work by cooling a fire down in order to put it out).</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Some examples of fire hazards found in hospitality/catering organisations may include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Electrical equipment</li>
										<li>Gas canisters</li>
										<li>Alcohol</li>
										<li>Cardboard or plastic packaging</li>
										<li>Tablecloths and napkins</li>
										<li>Cigarette ends</li>
										<li>Cooking oil</li>
										<li>Dusts</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The following steps can be taken in order to reduce the risk of fire:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Minimise the amount of flammable materials/substances (those that can fuel a fire) that are stored and, where these materials/substances are needed, make sure they are stored safely and securely</li>
										<li>Keep flammable materials well away from any sparks that could light a fire (such as cigarette ends or electrical sparks)</li>
										<li>Carry out regular checks and inspections on all gas and electrical equipment</li>
										<li>Store gas canisters and oils outside</li>
										<li>Make sure smoking areas are well away from flammable materials/substances</li>
										<li>Regular cleaning to avoid build-up of rubbish and dust</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>A hospitality/catering organisation must consider all of the hazards that we have looked at on this page and, for each hazard, evaluate whether there is a low, medium or high risk of harm being caused (and also the severity of harm that could be caused). The organisation will do this as part of its risk assessment activities.</p>
						<p>A high level of risk means that the event is very likely to occur, and it may cause death or serious injury/illness. A low level of risk is one where an event is very unlikely to occur and, if it did, it would cause only minor illness/injury. A medium level of risk sits somewhere between those in these high and low categories.</p>
						<p>For any high or medium risk events that are identified, the organisation will need to take appropriate action in order to remove the hazard and reduce the level of risk.</p>
						<p>An organisation would also consider relevant control measures when evaluating risks – you will learn more about control measures later in this Session.</p>
