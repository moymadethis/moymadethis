						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Identifying risks to security</h1>
					</div>
					<p>As well as the risks to health and safety that we looked at on the previous page, there may also be security risks in the workplace.</p>
					<div class="boxout think-first">
						<h2 class="think-first__title">Think first</h2>
						<p>Can you think of any examples of security risks that may exist in a hospitality/catering organisation? Types some ideas in the box below before you move on.</p>
						<form class="journal-entry">

					</div>
					<p>Security risks in hospitality/catering would arise from any unauthorised person gaining access to the organisation’s building, with the intention of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Causing harm/damage to people</li>
						<li>Causing harm/damage to property</li>
						<li>Stealing belongings</li>
						<li>Stealing cash</li>
						<li>Stealing equipment</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These security risks can apply to anyone who may be in the organisation’s building when unauthorised access takes place – including employers, employees, customers and suppliers.</p>
					<p>There are a range of actions and security procedures that organisations can put in place in order to protect people, property, equipment, belongings and cash. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Including safes in hotel guest rooms</li>
						<li>Providing lockers for staff to store their belongings while they are at work</li>
						<li>Having dedicated staff who are responsible for handling cash and ensuring that cash is kept locked away at all times</li>
						<li>Use of secure entry systems – for example, in a hotel, guests may need to scan their room card to enter the hotel or access certain areas of the hotel, and staff may be given a secure pin code to unlock staff entrances</li>
						<li>Providing staff and authorised visitors with security/ID passes to wear – this means that any unauthorised visitors are easier to spot as they will be without a security pass</li>
						<li>Encouraging all staff and visitors to be observant and to challenge/report any unauthorised visitors or unusual events</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Hospitality staff who are responsible for dealing with customer’s property will need to be particularly careful when it comes to security and following procedures. If a member of staff is responsible for the loss or damage of a customer’s belongings, this would reflect badly on the organisation as a whole. For example, if a porter is asked to store a customer’s luggage, and the luggage then goes missing, the customer will hold the porter responsible for this loss.</p>
					<div class="boxout key-point">
						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>As with risks to health, an organisation will need to evaluate security risks and categorise them as low, medium or high. The organisation will need to make sure appropriate security procedures are in place to minimise hazards that could potentially lead to security risks.</p>
