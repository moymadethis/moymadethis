						<h2 class="assessment__title">Preparing for your assessment</h2>
						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Describe personal safety responsibilities in the workplace</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information over the following pages to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Health and safety at work is very important. Without effective health and safety controls in place, accidents can occur causing harm to staff and customers. Businesses need to ensure that they provide a healthy, safe and secure environment for both its staff and its customers – healthy and safe staff will work more efficiently and effectively, while customers will enjoy their hospitality experience much more if they feel they are in a healthy and safe environment.</p>
					<p>Employers and employees both have specific responsibilities when it comes to maintaining health and safety in the workplace. There are key pieces of health and safety legislation that outline these responsibilities and the actions that employers and employees must take in order to operate within the law.</p>
					<p>Click through the slide panel below to explore key health and safety legislation.</p>
					<div class="flexslider-wrap">
						<div class="flexslider">
							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Health and Safety at Work Act 1974</h2>
									<p>The Health and Safety at Work Act (or HASAWA) is the main piece of legislation relating to health and safety – it sets out specific responsibilities for both employers and employees.</p>
									<p>According to the Health and Safety at Work Act, <strong>employers</strong> must...</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Make sure that the health and safety of the workplace is checked and monitored regularly</li>
										<li>Provide equipment that is safe to use (not dangerous or a risk to health)</li>
										<li>Have specific safe storage for substances that could be a risk to health and/or safety</li>
										<li>Have a written health and safety policy if they employ five or more workers – this policy must be communicated to all staff and staff must know where they can find it when needed</li>
										<li>Take appropriate actions to ensure that all work practices are safe</li>
										<li>Offer health and safety information, instruction, guidance and training for staff (this can be used to remind staff of correct health and safety processes, help them to understand the key legal requirements they must follow in their job and train them in dealing with hazards in the workplace)</li>
										<li>Make sure there are toilets, places to wash and drinking water for workers</li>
										<li>Make sure that there is first aid provision</li>
										<li>Have insurance to cover any injury or illness at work</li>
										<li>Ensure safe entrance to and exit from the workplace</li>
										<li>Have arrangements in place to prevent fires, and to raise the alarm and evacuate the premises in case of fire (notices showing safe evacuation routes must be clearly displayed in the building)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>According to the Health and Safety at Work Act, <strong>employees</strong> must...</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Take reasonable care for their own health and safety at work</li>
										<li>Make sure that their own actions do not put others at risk (this also includes any actions they choose not to take)</li>
										<li>Always comply with the specific safety rules and practices relevant to the job they are doing</li>
										<li>Report any fire/safety hazards to their line manager as quickly as possible</li>
										<li>Wear any protective clothing that is supplied by the employer and required as part of their role</li>
										<li>Report all injuries or dangerous incidents</li>
										<li>Attend any health and safety training sessions and safety briefings as required by their employer</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR)</h2>
									<p>RIDDOR places responsibility on employers (or any other person in charge of a workplace) to report certain serious accidents, diseases, dangerous occurrences and near misses. Employees have a responsibility to tell their line manager about injuries or dangerous occurrences in the workplace, so that they can be recorded and reported. Members of the public and the injured person themselves can also report an accident.</p>
									<p>Examples of reportable incidents include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Death arising from a work-related accident</li>
										<li>Specified injuries arising from a work-related accident (these include fractures, other than to fingers, thumbs and toes, amputations, injuries leading to loss of sight or reduction in sight, crush injuries to the head or torso and serious burns)</li>
										<li>Accidents leading to a person being away from work for more than seven consecutive days</li>
										<li>Accidents involving members of the public, if they result in an injury and the person is taken to hospital</li>
										<li>Occupational diseases, which are caused or made worse by work activities (such as carpal tunnel syndrome)</li>
										<li>Dangerous occurrences (for example, collapse of equipment, or the accidental release of dangerous substances)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Accidents/incidents are reported to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). This can be done online or by telephone. When reporting an accident/incident, the organisation should be a record of the report that has been made, including the date of the report, how the report was made (online or by telephone), the date/time/place of the accident or incident, personal details of those involved and a brief description of the event. The organisation can use this information to analyse the event and take steps to avoid something similar happening again in the future.</p>
									<p>Even if an accident does not need to be reported under RIDDOR legislation, <strong>every accident</strong> in the workplace must be written up in an accident log. By keeping an up to date accident log, employers can identify any ongoing health and safety issues/concerns and take appropriate actions.</p>
									<p>It is very important that staff know the correct procedure for reporting accidents, injuries, incidents and hazards (either within the organisation or to the HSE).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH) 2002</h2>
									<p>The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations relate to any substance that may be dangerous or have the potential to cause harm. Most organisations will use at least some of the substances that come under this heading, for example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Chemicals)</li>
										<li>Products containing chemicals)</li>
										<li>Fumes)</li>
										<li>Dusts)</li>
										<li>Medicines)</li>
										<li>Vapours)</li>
										<li>Mists)</li>
										<li>Nanotechnology)</li>
										<li>Gases and asphyxiating gases)</li>
										<li>Biological agents (germs)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>For hospitality and catering organisations, chemicals contained in cleaning materials are probably the most common hazardous substance. As stated in the Health and Safety at Work Act, an employer would need to make sure that safe storage is provided for these chemicals in order to control the risk and protect others from harm. Members of staff may also attend training on the safe use and storage of the chemicals, so that they understand the risks and know how to use the chemicals safely and correctly. These actions will also protect customers from harm, as the chemical substances are stored and used safely.</p>
									<p>The COSHH regulations state that employees have a responsibility to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Use control measures and facilities set out by the employer for safe handling of substances</li>
										<li>Ensure that equipment is returned and stored properly</li>
										<li>Report any defects in the control measures</li>
										<li>Wear any personal protective equipment (PPE) provided when handling substances</li>
										<li>Removing PPE before eating or drinking, in order to avoid contamination</li>
										<li>Maintain a high level of personal hygiene</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Manual Handling Operations Regulations</h2>
									<p>Manual handling causes over a third of all workplace injuries. Under these regulations, ‘manual handling’ is defined as: <em>“Any transporting or supporting of a load (including the lifting, putting down, pushing, pulling, carrying or moving thereof) by hand or bodily force.”</em></p>
									<p>There are three key steps for an employer to take in order to deal with manual handling risks in the workplace – these are:</p>
									<ol class="list-numbers">
										<li>Avoid hazardous manual handling operations, as far as reasonably possible</li>
										<li>Assess any hazardous manual handling operations that cannot be avoided</li>
										<li>Use this assessment to reduce the risk of injury, as much as possible</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Let’s consider some examples of manual handling that could take place in a kitchen environment. Staff may be required to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Lift heavy items (boxes of supplies, pots and pans filled with water or food, etc)</li>
										<li>Push or pull trolleys full of food/ingredients/plates/dishes, etc</li>
										<li>Use bodily force to clean large, dirty items including pans and ovens</li>
									</ul>
									<p>An employer may provide training and information to staff on correct techniques to use when lifting and carrying heavy objects. You can read some useful guidance on good manual handling techniques on <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/manual.htm" target="_blank">hse.gov.uk website</a></p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations</h2>
									<p>Personal Protective Equipment (or PPE) includes any equipment that will protect people from harm in the workplace. This includes items such as:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Safety helmets</li>
										<li>Gloves</li>
										<li>Eye protection</li>
										<li>High-visibility clothing</li>
										<li>Safety footwear</li>
										<li>Harnesses</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Under these regulations, employers have a responsibility to:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Provide suitable PPE where required, at no cost to employees</li>
										<li>Ensure that PPE is safe to use and well maintained</li>
										<li>Provide suitable storage and cleaning facilities for PPE</li>
										<li>Provide suitable training and information to staff on the use of PPE</li>
										<li>Replacing PPE when it is faulty or has defects</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Employees are responsible for:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Wearing/using PPE safely and correctly when required</li>
										<li>Cleaning and storing the PPE correctly after use</li>
										<li>Reporting any faults or defects in PPE</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Examples of PPE in the hospitality and catering industry may include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Chefs wearing non-slip shoes in the kitchen, to avoid the risk of slipping and falling</li>
										<li>A chef’s double-breasted jacket, which is designed to provide a barrier against burns</li>
										<li>Cut resistant gloves worn during food preparation, in particular when using sharp knives to cut through thick or tough ingredients (such as bones in meat)</li>
										<li>Oven gloves to protect hands from hot equipment in the kitchen</li>
										<li>If particularly harmful cleaning materials are to be used, then long gloves and safety goggles may need to be worn</li>
										<li>Wearing food safe gloves and hair nets when preparing food, in order to prevent food becoming contaminated</li>
									</ul>
								</li>

						<h2 class="key-point__title">Key point</h2>
						<p>The Health and Safety at Work Act requires employers to carry out risk assessments, to ensure that they are complying with the legislation. The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify potential risks in the workplace and put appropriate measures in place to reduce or remove these risks. Employers have a duty of care to their employees and risk assessments help employers to ensure that all staff have a healthy, safe and secure workplace. Risk assessments also help staff to understand the particular risks within their jobs and the actions they should take to manage these risks in order to protect themselves and others.</p>
						<p>You will learn more about risk assessments in the next Session of this Unit.</p>
