						<h2 class="assessment__title">Preparing for your assessment</h2>
						<p>In your assessment for this Unit, you will need to be able to demonstrate that you are able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Recommend personal safety control measures for hospitality and catering provision</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You’ll find lots of useful information on this page to help you complete this part of your assessment.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Control measures are actions that can be taken to remove a hazard or reduce the likelihood of risk being caused by a hazard. We have covered a wide range of control measures already in this Session – for example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Storing chemicals safely and securely</li>
						<li>Providing protective equipment for staff carrying out hazardous tasks</li>
						<li>Providing appropriate training and information to reduce the potential for harm (for example, correct lifting techniques for manual handling operations, training on safe use of knives in the kitchen, etc)</li>
						<li>Keeping flammable materials separate from heat sources, to reduce the risk of fire</li>
						<li>Reporting of accidents and dangerous occurrences</li>
						<li>Keeping work areas clean and clear from obstructions</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Control measures are essential in ensuring health and safety of both employees and customers. Take a look at the table below to see some examples of control measures and the benefit they can have for employees and/or customers.</p>
