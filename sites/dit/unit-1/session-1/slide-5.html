					<p>There are three main types of user interface – these are:</p>
					<ol class="list-numbers">
						<li>Command-line (text based)</li>
						<li>Menu-driven</li>
						<li>Graphical user interface (GUI)</li>
					</ol>

									<h2>Text based interfaces</h2>
									<p>Text based interfaces, sometimes referred to as command-line, allow the user to interact with a computer by typing in text commands (there are no graphics used within the interface). The computer displays a prompt, the user keys in the command and presses enter or return.</p>
									<p>For many years this was the only software user interaction method available on computers via a keyboard or keypad!</p>
									<p>Features of a text based interface include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Commands must be typed in correctly and using the correct <a href="#glossary" class="fancybox">syntax</a></li>
										<li>Not much processing power required from the computer device (as graphics are not used)</li>
										<li>Text based interface can run programs, save/open files and perform most other basic tasks on a computer device</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Speech/natural language interfaces</h2>
									<p>Speech/natural language interfaces (sometimes referred to as Voice User) are a type of computer human interface where spoken language such as verbs, phrases and clauses act as prompts and controls for searching, creating, selecting and modifying data in software applications.</p>
									<p>Natural language interfaces are popular in more modern computer devices for their speed and ease of use, but most can suffer the challenges of having to understand a wide varieties of input.</p>
									<p>Barriers such as background noise, volume and regional accents make natural language technology a challenging industry.</p>

									<h2>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) & WIMPs (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer)</h2>
									<p>Both GUIs and WIMPs are user interfaces that use visual display via a monitor output. This visual display will provide clickable graphics as shortcuts to longer, more complex text commands, making it much easier to interact with a computer device.</p>
									<p>The invention of GUIs has led to more people being able to access computer technology, therefore decreasing the digital divide between those that can and cannot access technology.</p>
									<p>Some of the main features of GUIs include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>They are much easier to use for beginners (children, elderly, those with impairments)</li>
										<li>They enable you to easily exchange information between software using cut and paste or 'drag and drop'</li>
										<li>They use a lot of memory and processing power (it can be slower to use than a command-line interface if you are an expert user)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The use of GUIs and WIMPs have also allowed for more creativity and innovation from a formatting perspective where text command is limited. A good GUI should:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Be aesthetically pleasing to the eye</li>
										<li>Allow the user to experiment with different options easily</li>
										<li>Be simple to use</li>
										<li>Use colours for purpose and meaning</li>
										<li>Use typography that is clear</li>
										<li>Use language that is simple and concise</li>
										<li>Provide access to help documentation</li>
										<li>Use clear and consistent icons</li>
									</ul>

									<h2>Sensor interfaces</h2>
									<p>A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. This could be light, movement, sound, temperature, etc. The output is converted to a display that can be interpreted by a human. For example, a sensor in a user interface might detect a sound wave for a speech interface, measured points in a face for a facial recognition system or if the computer device is on its side (orientation).</p>
									<p>Computer devices can contain many different sensors which can be used to track movement. These sensors are often also now found in smart phones – they are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Pedometer – senses the footsteps you take over time.</li>
										<li>Accelerometer – senses the acceleration of the device in 3 dimensions</li>
										<li>Heart rate sensor – senses the wearer’s pulse from their wrist.</li>
										<li>Gyroscope – helps the accelerometer out with understanding which way the phone is orientated.</li>
										<li>Magnetometer – measures magnetic fields, helping to determine north, south, east and west.</li>
										<li>GPS (Global positioning system) - collects pings from satellites (at least 4) to pinpoint your position on planet earth.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Sensors can be used to gather data from a variety of variables. This could be to either just store raw data for analysis or to control an application. It could be to gather data on temperature changes to measure climate change, to collect light from distant stars to determine their composition or to gather people’s locations to better learn their movements for market research. Sensors can control devices such as alarm systems i.e. if a sensor detects movement, the alarm goes off.</p>
									<h4>Advantages:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Accuracy and consistency – Sensors are more accurate and consistent than humans.</li>
										<li>Responsive – Sensors respond instantly to changes, such as in the alarm example above.</li>
										<li>Durable – Sensors can go where humans cannot survive, such as inhospitable environments like space.</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Faulty sensors can give incorrect results which can lead to catastrophic results – for example, consider what would happen if the sensors failed on a driverless car!</li>
									</ul>
								</li>

									<h2>Menu-driven interfaces</h2>
									<p>A menu-driven interface is an interface consisting of a series of screens which are navigated by choosing options from lists (menus). Because of their simplicity, menu-driven interfaces are commonly used for walk-up-and-use systems, such as information kiosks and ATMs. Websites are also often designed with the same basic navigation principle, where navigation bars substitute for “menus”.</p>
									<h4>Simple menu</h4>
									<p>The user is offered a simple menu from which to choose an option. One menu often leads to a further menu. Part of the screen may have an instruction followed by a numbered list of options to choose from.</p>
									<h4>Full screen menu</h4>
									<p>A full screen menu takes up the entire screen.</p>
									<h4>Menu bar</h4>
									<p>A menu bar contains a set of options at the top of the screen. When an option is chosen a drop-down menu of additional options may be offered.</p>
									<h4>Features of menu-driven interfaces include:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>They are easy to use as the user does not have to remember sets of commands</li>
										<li>They are user friendly – you can often guess your way around the options</li>
										<li>They can be irritating if there are too many levels of menus to move around – with a command-line interface you can go to the option required immediately</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Form interfaces</h2>
									<p>A form interface allows a user to enter data using a variety of form controls such as short answer boxes, radio buttons and so on.</p>
									<p>Features of a form interface include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Data can be easily entered and submitted</li>
										<li>A wide variety of questions can be asked such as open/closed, quantitative/qualitative</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Form interfaces are best used when collecting and storing data from a user. Forms must be clear, concise and take into consideration ethical and legal restrictions.</p>
