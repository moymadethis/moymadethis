						<h1 class="hgroup__title">Factors affecting the choice of user interface</h1>
					</div>
					<p>There are many factors that can affect the choice of user interface for different computer devices. These factors need to be considered in the initial assessment and design stages of the project life cycle in order to design and create an interface that is perfectly tailored to the target consumer.</p>
					<div class="boxout think-first">
						<h2 class="think-first__title">Think first</h2>
						<p>Can you think of any factors that may need to be considered when designing and creating a user interface? Type some ideas into the box below before you move on.</p>
						<form class="journal-entry">
							<textarea rows="4" placeholder="Make some notes (optional)..."></textarea>
							<button class="btn btn--primary btn--save"><span>Save</span></button>
						</form>
					</div>
					<p>Now click through the slide panel below to explore some of the factors to be considered.</p>
					<div class="flexslider-wrap">
						<div class="flexslider">
							<ul class="slides">
								<li>
									<h2>Performance/response time</h2>
									<p>The performance of the user interface is crucial to a successful design. You should consider how quickly a user interface can allow you to complete a task, how many layers you need to navigate through in order to achieve a goal, how many alternative methods of navigation are on offer for the same solution, etc.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Usability (ease of use)</h2>
									<p>A user interface needs to be easy to use. If it is challenging or particularly complex, then most users will give up and go to a competitor’s product. A user interface must be intuitive and therefore allow a user to be able to predict the usability of the interface with little previous experience. An interface you can pick up and use without instructions is a good usable interface.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>User requirements</h2>
									<p>Consider the needs that different users may have when it comes to accessing the interface and completing tasks. It’s likely you will never satisfy every requirement; however, by covering the majority of user needs, you make your interface more accessible.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>User experience</h2>
									<p>Different users will have different levels of experience in using digital interfaces. If a user can recognise elements of an interface because they have used similar interfaces in the past, then it may persuade them to use that interface over rival products/devices.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Accessibility</h2>
									<p>As previously mentioned, different users have different needs which can be physical or mental. Accessibility needs to consider could be visual, auditory, language and learning. Some of the most successful interfaces are customisable to allow those with impairments to still access the product/device by making certain adjustments (such as increasing text size, changing background colours, etc).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Storage space</h2>
									<p>The amount of storage space on a device can have a direct impact on the type of user interface you can use. For instance a text command line interface doesn’t take up much storage however can be difficult to navigate for all users. A GUI or speech/language interface would be a lot easier to use but would take up a lot more storage space due to graphics, pixels and other large amounts of data.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="boxout think-first">
						<h2 class="think-first__title">Activity</h2>
						<p>Consider the following two scenarios:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>A school is looking to redesign its website. Staff are aware of some parents and students having impairments, which could mean that they struggle to access conventional user interfaces. What would you consider for these parents and students when designing a user interface?</li>
							<li>Top Furniture is a company that manufactures contemporary wooden furniture. They have a dedicated email address for customer enquiries and receive dozens of emails every day. The company has 10 members of staff and some of them have accessibility needs. In groups, decide which four factors you consider to be the most important when choosing the user interface that all staff at Top Furniture will use. Justify why you have chosen each factor.</li>
