						<h3>Target audience</h3>
						<p>A target audience is made up of the stereotypical person(s) you are aiming your product at. When developing a picture of a target audience, you may consider the following areas:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Age range</li>
							<li>Gender (if appropriate)</li>
							<li>Ethnicity/culture/language</li>
							<li>Demographics (where they live, who lives with them, household income)</li>
						</ul>

								<li>
									<h2>Age</h2>
									<p>A person’s age can determine their level of experience and skill when it comes to using digital devices.</p>
									<p>When designing an interface, you could consider:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>What specific age range will be using your product and interfaces?</li>
										<li>What devices do they already use regularly</li>
										<li>How does their age impact on other factors such as past experiences and education?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Beliefs, values and culture</h2>
									<p>Each human culture comes with rules and traditions to living life which impact on what products and devices are used. Cultural considerations include where you are born, what religion you follow and what language you speak.</p>
									<p>Considerations for a designer include different languages, regional accents and slang/pronunciation (particularly when considering speech-based interactions), use of symbols and colours and the different meanings they may have across different cultural groups (for example, Western cultures in Europe and North America associate the colour yellow with warmth and happiness; however, this colour is associated with death in many Latin cultures).</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Household income</h2>
									<p>The household income can impact on the level of technology and digital devices that are available in the home and therefore the interfaces that a person has access to on a daily basis. Income levels can also be a measure of education and what they can potentially afford.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h2>Past experiences</h2>
									<p>By finding out about the past experiences of a target audience, you can begin to understand the technological journey they have been on so far – namely, what interfaces they are used to and what devices they have experience of using.</p>
									<p>By creating a user interface which is consistent with the previous experiences of users, they will find the interface easy to access and use (as they find the features similar to others they have used).</p>
									<p>You can build up a picture of your target audience’s level of past experience through either primary research (such as carrying out questionnaires and surveys directly to the target audience), secondary research bought in from other sources or through transactional data collected using cookie technology.</p>
